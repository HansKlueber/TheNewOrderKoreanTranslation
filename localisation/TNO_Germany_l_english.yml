### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "대독일국의 영도자이자 총리이며 19개 국가를 다스리는 의심할 여지 없는 폭군, 세계수도 게르마니아의 건축가, 독일 국방군의 최고사령관, 국가사회주의독일노동자당의 영도자, 그리고 타임지의 1938년, 1946년, 그리고 1961년의 올해의 인물인 아돌프 히틀러를 정의하기 위해서는 과연 어디부터 시작해야 할까요?\n\n오스트리아 여관 주인의 아들이라는 겸손한 시작을 한 그는 뮌헨과 빈에서 수학하였고 제1차 세계대전 당시 독일군에서 복무하며 뛰어난 공훈을 세웠습니다. 그가 혜성과 같이 나타나 정권을 잡았다는 사실은 그 누구도 부인할 수 없으며, 뮌헨 봉기와 같은 실패한 시도들은 오로지 그의 야망을 더더욱 키워주었을 뿐이었습니다. 그의 폭력과 쇼맨십의 조합은 공산주의자들과 민주주의자들을 라이히스탁에서 몰아냈으며 그를 최고의 자리에 올려놓았습니다. 그의 영도 하에서, 독일은 베르사유 조약의 족쇄를 끊었으며, 새롭고 무시무시한 군대를 육성하였고, 대서양 해안가에서 흑해에 이르기까지 전 유럽에 스바스티카가 휘날리도록 유럽의 다른 국가들을 무릎 꿇게 만들었습니다. 그의 영도 하에서 라이히는 아틀란트로파와 게르마니아 같은 불가사의를 건설하였고, 그의 감시 하에 유럽의 악질분자들은 맹렬히 절멸되었고 불길의 먹이가 되었습니다.\n\n그러나 독일 전역과 우랄과 피레네 사이의 유럽 전역의 구세주이자 지도자는, 늙었습니다. 한때 넋빠진 청중들의 이목을 좌지우지하던 그의 목소리는 이제는 단지 쉬었을 뿐이며, 차갑고 타산적인 강철의 정신은 녹슬었습니다. 그의 기억에서 미끄러져 나가는 오래 전에 죽은 이들의 얼굴에 최후의 붓놀림을 더하면서, 나의 투쟁을 집필한 손은 이제는 끊임없이 흔들리고 있습니다. 알렉산드로스와 나폴레옹 이후 세계 최고의 정복자는 이제는 늙고 노쇠한 인간입니다. 1962년, 그는 73세이며, 몇몇은 감히 그가 이 세계에 남을 날이 그리 길지 않다고 속삭이고 있습니다. 만일 영도자의 장례식이 거행된다면, 유럽 전역에 다시 한 번 전쟁의 불길이 타오르리라고, 전세계는 두려움에 떨고 있습니다."
 REICHSTAG_EMERGENCY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "영도자께서는 비극적으로 돌아가셨으며, 라이히는 그 소식에 충격받았습니다. 그 누가 과연 그 천하무적의 인간이 죽으리라고 생각했을까요?\n\n분명히 라이히스탁은 아닐 것입니다.\n\n그의 후계자가 누가 될 것인지 영도자 각하께서 확실하게 지정하셨음에도 불구하고, 정부의 많은 이들은 무기를 들었습니다. 개혁주의자들, 보수주의자들, 강경주의자들, 그리고 광신주의자들은 서로 맹렬히 싸우고 있습니다. 결과적으로, 그 어떤 파벌의 일원이 되기에는 지나치게 인기가 없는 형세관망자들과 무명의 관료들, 그리고 다른 라이히스탁 의원들은 서로 뭉쳐, 지난 30년 동안 집단적으로 무시받던 헌법에 의거하여 자신들을 새로운 영도자가 취임할 때까지의 공식적인 중개 행정부라고 선언하였습니다.\n\n총통직의 주 경쟁자들은 모두 이 비상회의에 매우 적은 관심을 두고 있으며 좋게 말하자면 후보 선수, 나쁘게 말하자면 불순종적인 반역자라고 보고 있습니다. 이들의 존재가 주는 가장 긍정적인 효과는 게르마니아에 안정의 그림자라도 드리우게 되었다는 것이며, 도시가 혼돈에 빠져드는 것을 막음으로서 더 적합한 지도자가 (희망적으로) 주도할 수 있게 만드는 것입니다. 그들은 로마를 대화재로부터 막아냈으나 제국의 나머지 지역들이 불길에 휩싸이는 것을 방관할 것입니다."
 POLITICS_HANS_SPIEDEL_DESC:0 "슈파이델이 국방군에서 자랑스럽게 복무한지, 그리고 조국이 그를 자랑스럽게 여긴지 오랜 시간이 지났습니다. 그는 그가 전투에서의 용맹을 증명하여 곡엽검금강석 기사십자 철십자장을 얻은 계기가 된 50년대의 서러시아 전쟁이 절정에 달할 즈음에 SS에 대항하여 일으킨 빠른 쿠데타를 일으킴으로서 내전을 간신히 막아냈고, 그는 이를 통해 처음으로 유명세에 올랐습니다. 떠오르는 별이 된 그는 추가적으로 그의 오랜 상관과 개인적인 친구인 에르빈 롬멜의 인기에 편승했고 독일에서 가장 사랑받는 인물 중 하나가 되었습니다. 이후 슈파이델은 페르디난트 쇠르너를 위시한 라이히의 많은 군국주의자들에 대항했고, 그 자신의 이익을 위하여 쇠르너가 국방군의 통제권을 얻는 것을 막으면서 그는 생애 두번째로 라이히에서의 쿠데타를 예방했습니다.\n\n여전히 슈파이델은 정치인이 아니며 커지고 있는 국방군과 정부의 유대관계에 강한 반감을 느끼고 있습니다. 라이히의 군 통수권이 그 자신을 파괴할 수 있다는 사실을 두려워한 그는 그의 의무는 언제나 국민들을 위한 것이라고 말하며 그를 라이히에 있는 수많은 파벌 중 하나로 끌어들이려는 모든 꼬드김과 매수 시도를 거부하였습니다. 슈파이델의 충성심은 곧 그가 소용돌이치는 바다 한가운데 있는 작은 섬이라는 것을 의미하며, 파도는 매일 더더욱 높아지고 있습니다."

 GER_Theodor_Oberlander_hog_desc:0 "------------\n고학력이고 독선적인데다 논란되는 라이히스탁 의장 테오도어 오버란더는 NADAP 내에서 이례적으로 승진했습니다. 슈페어주의자들은 그를 보수주의자, 심지어 반동이라고 생각하지만 정통파 국가사회주의자들은 그를 라이히의 고통스러운 구조로부터 위대한 개혁을 이루고 이념은 지키되 슈페어보단 덜 악랄한 개혁가라고 생각합니다.\n\n오베를렌더는 농업과 경제학에서 박사학위를 취득한 뒤 방첩국에서 근무를 시작하고, 이후 우크라이나 베르그만 대대에서 근무했습니다. 하지만 총통께서 몇장의 편지를 보내 그의 동부종합계획의 인종계획이 국가사회주의를 오용했다고 비판하신 직후 그는 직위에서 해임되었습니다.\n\n그는 이에 굴하지 않고, 정계에 입문해서 프라하 대학 교수직에서 선거운동에 임하고, 라이히스탁에 간신히 의석을 사수했습니다. NSDAP 개혁파의 초기 창립맴버로서 오버란더는 그 건축가가 이념적 실패를 바로잡는 것 보다 학생과 좌파들에게 호소하는것에 더 집중하자 슈페어와 결별했습니다. 그 어떤 파벌도 오버란더의 사상을 좋아하진 않지만 라이히의 시민들은 그와 그 이념을 좋아합니다."

  MILITARY_HENNING_VON_TRESCKOW_DESC:0 "------------\n최후의 프로이센인이라고 불리는 헤닝 폰 트레슈코프는 국방군 장군으로서 잘 알려져 있습니다. 폰 트레슈코프는 브란덴부르크 귀족가문에서 태어나 가문의 자랑스러운 군복무 역사를 이어 1차 대전에서 복무했습니다. 패전이후 폰 트레슈코프는 베르사유 조약의 영토상실을 복구할 유일한 계책이 나치당이라 믿고 나치 활동에 참가했습니다. 그러나 이러한 이상주의는 장검의 밤 도중에 산산조각났고 그는 NSDAP에 대한 증오심을 갖기 시작했습니다.\n\n그럼에도 불구하고 폰 트레슈코프는 2차대전에서 훌륭히 복무했고 특히 동부전선에서 수많은 작전을 지휘해 부하린의 패망과 라이히의 승리에 크게 기여했습니다. 소문에 의하면 트레슈코프는 전쟁 중 훗날 당과 총통에 관련된 음모로 체포되거나 처형되는 몇몇 개인과 접촉했다고 알려져있습니다. 하지만 폰 트레슈코프 본인은 이러한 범죄와 전혀 연관되지 않았고 이러한 소문은 빠르게 가라앉았습니다.\n\n엄격하고 고풍스러운 프로이센 남자로서 폰 트레슈코프는 육군이 정치화되고 사법적인 절차를 무시하고 참사를 저지르는 라이히를 경멸하고 있습니다. 놀랍게도 트레슈코프의 보수적인 프로이센 유풍이 군부의 진보적인 목소리를 대변하고 있습니다. 알베르트 슈페어는 그가 자신의 내각에 들어오는 것을 환영했습니다. 늙은 군인은 그가 나치가 부순 독일의 황금기를 복구할 기회를 얻은것에 기뻐하고 있으나 그가 그러기 위해 정치에 입문해야 한다는 사실은 경멸하고있습니다."

  MILITARY_HANS_SPEIDEL_DESC:0 "------------\n한스 슈파이델은 독일의 많은 원로 장성들처럼 1차대전 참전용사입니다. 솜 전투에서 중대장으로 참전했고 베르사유 조약으로 군이 축소되었을 때 군에 남아있었습니다. 그는 2차대전에서 독일이 힘을 되찾을 때도 훌륭히 복무했습니다. 그중에도 슈파이델은 2차대전중 부하린과 그의 볼셰비키 동지들에게 가장 큰 타격을 입힌 레닌그라드 정복으로 유명합니다.\n\n슈파이델은 의심의 여지없이 국방군 최고사령부에서 가장 강력한 사람이고 그걸 보여줄 재능있는 사람입니다. 라이히 개혁파의 지도자로서 슈파이델은 독일이 세계 패권을 유지해야 한다고 생각하지만 그가 생각하기에도 구시대적이고 야만적이라고 생각하는 나치의 인종정책에는 별로 관심을 기울이지 않습니다. 그런 그는 라이히를 위해 현대화의 이점을 추구하고 국가사회주의의 이상한점을 거부해왔습니다.\n\n그의 이런 점은 NSDAP에서 연줄이 없는점과 맞물려 라이히 내에 많은 적을 만들었습니다. 그가 국방군 최고사령부 사령관으로 취임했을 때 라이히의 보수파와 반동들은 격분했고 개혁파 또한 놀랐습니다. 그의 정치적 신념과 관계없이 그의 복무기록은 전혀 흠잡을데 없습니다."

 ## Opening
 GER_a_man_on_the_moon:0 "달에 간 사람"
 GER_a_man_on_the_moon_desc:0 "수십 년의 지루한 연구와 지속적인 진보의 절정이 반복된 끝에, 독일 항공우주센터의 베르너 폰 박사는 현재까지 준비해온 가장 위대한 작업을 시작할 준비가 되어 있습니다. 그것은 바로 최초의 사람을 달에 착륙시키는 것입니다. 만약 성공한다면, 그것은 원자폭탄 이후, 제국의 가장 위대한 과학적 업적이 될 것이며, 국가사회주의에 맞서는 미국인과 일본인들을 다시 한번 놀래키게 될 것입니다. '우주 경쟁'은 이걸로 끝입니다. 하일 히틀러!"
 GER_the_enemy_of_my_enemy:0 "적의 적"
 GER_the_enemy_of_my_enemy_desc:0 "제2차 세계대전 당시 우리가 베풀어준 은혜에도 불구하고, 일본 제국과의 외교관계는 더욱 더 냉랭해졌습니다. 우리는 동양에서의 이익을 위해 우리보다 일본을 더 경멸하는 과거에 적이였던, 즉 미국과의 관계를 완만하게 할 때인것 같습니다. 우리와 반대되는 사상과 과거에도 불구하고, 관계를 개선할 수 있다면, 우리는 사무라이를 막으면서, 떠오르려는 태양을 막을 수 있을 것입니다."
 GER_the_speer_proposal:0 "슈페어의 제안"
 GER_the_speer_proposal_desc:0 "알베르트 슈페어는 경제장관으로서 대게르만국의 경제상황 문제에 관한 유일한 최고의 권위자입니다. 슈페어는 총통의 신임 아래, NSPAD내에서 상당한 영향력을 획득하여, 독일의 국내외 정책 결정에 영향을 미칠 수 있게 되었습니다. 이러한 영향력을 감안하여 슈페어는 이제 일본 제국의 영향력에 성공적으로 대항하기 위해 미국과의 무역 및 외교 관계의 새로운 정책을 제시했습니다."
 GER_ease_the_embargoes:0 "엠바고 완화"
 GER_ease_the_embargoes_desc:0 "유감스럽게도 대게르만국과 아인하이츠팍트는 현재 미국과 그들의 자유국가기구(OFN)로부터 무역 금수 조치를 받고 있습니다. 하지만 슈페어 장관의 제안이 채택되면서, 이곳은 곧 바뀔지도 모릅니다. 슈페어의 제안에 따라, 우리는 OFN과 유니티 팍트 사이의 특정 삼품에 대한 무역 제제 완화를 위한 회담을 주선하기 위해, 미국 정부에 화해의 손길을 뻗어야 할 것입니다. 만약 우리가 우리의 시도에 성공하단면, 예상되는 무역 증가는 제국의 절박한 경제를 희망적으로 활성화시킬 것입니다."
 GER_the_almighty_dollar:0 "전능하신 달러"
 GER_the_almighty_dollar_desc:0 "국제 시장에서 미국의 달러화에 비해, 우리의 라이히스마르크가 놀라울 정도로 약세를 보이는 가운데, 슈페어 장관은 정부가 우리의 엄격한 외화정책에 대한 과감한 개혁을 단행해 줄 것을 정부에 요청했습니다. 우리 자신의 외환 보유액이 엉망이 된 상황에서 개혁과 규제 완화를 통해, 국제경제적 지위를 높이고 그 과정에서 미국과의 경제관계 개선을 촉진할 수 있기를 희망했습니다."
 GER_the_red_telephone:0 "붉은 전화기"
 GER_the_red_telephone_desc:0 "최근 독일-미국 관계에서의 '데탕트'로 인해, 우리는 어떤 일이 일어나더라도, 이러한 이득을 유지하는 것을 목표로 하는 것이 최선입니다. 양국간의 갈등과 침략의 역사를 고려할 때, 게르마니아-워싱턴 핫라인 구축은 양국 지도자 모두에게 유익할 것이며, 위기 상황에서 총통과 대통령 사이의 직접전인 의사소통을 가능하게 할 것이라고 제안되었습니다. 두 나라 사이의 직접적인 연결고리는 두 국가들 사이의 위험을 방지하고, 인류 자체의 생존을 보장하는 데 핵심이 될 수 있습니다."
 GER_intelligence_sharing:0 "정보 공유"
 GER_intelligence_sharing_desc:0 "대서양 사이 국가들과의 새로운 협력 관계를 증진시키기 위해, 이제는 다소 급진적인 첩보 네트워크를 구축할 필요가 있습니다. 독일과 미국 정보기관 모두 서로 경쟁관계에 빠져 있지만, 우리는 이를 치워두고 일본 제국에 맞서 협력 증진을 위해 노력하는 것이 최선일 것입니다. 우리는 그들의 활동에 대한 정보를 공유할 준비가 되어 있다면, 우리 둘 다 점점 더 커져가는 일본의 영향력과 효과적으로 싸울 수 있을 것입니다."
 GER_the_trojan_horse:0 "트로이 목마"
 GER_the_trojan_horse_desc:0 "전 세계적으로 독일-미국 관계의 개선이 주시되고 있는 가운데, 미국과 제국의 시민들은 모두 이 '데탕트'가 계속되고 있던 냉랭한 분위기를 따뜻한 분위기로 이어지기를 바라고 있습니다. 전 세계가 지켜보는 가운데, 우리는 이제 가장 획기적인 외교행보에 착수할 것입니다. 우리는 미국인에게 잘 알려진 알베르트 슈페어 장관을 총통을 대신하여, 미국을 국빈 방문 하도록 할 것입니다. 이제까지만 해도 상상할 수 없었던 이 분위기에 전 세계의 국가들이 시선을 집중하고 있으며, 특히 가장 주의깊게 지켜보는 국가는 분명 일본 제국 일 것입니다."
 GER_the_bormann_proposal:0 "보어만의 제안"
 GER_the_bormann_proposal_desc:0 "당수부장으로서 마르틴 보어만은 제국 내에서 큰 힘을 휘두르고 있습니다. 총통의 지지 아래, NSDAP의 확고한 지도자로 부상하여, 독일의 국내외 정책 결정에 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있었습니다. 이러한 영향력에 비추어 볼 때, 당수부장 보어만은 일본 제국의 영향에 성공적으로 대항하기 위해 미국과의 협력 증대를 위한 제안을 정부에 제출했습니다."
 GER_joint_propaganda_efforts:0 "공동 선전 노력"
 GER_joint_propaganda_efforts_desc:0 "대게르만국과 미국 사이의 계속된 선전은 일본 제국에 대행하여, 협력 및 동맹을 맺으려는 시도에 큰 해가 된다는 것이 명백해 보입니다. 따라서 미국과 독일이 일본 제국에 대한 공동 선전 작전을 시행하게 된다면, 일본의 국제적 영향력을 실추시키는 데 큰 힘이 될 것이라는 의견이 제기되었습니다. 우리가 일본에 대항하여 단결하려면 그들의 악함에 대해 전세계에 통일된 목소리를 내야하기 때문입니다."
 GER_spy_exchanges:0 "스파이 교환"
 GER_spy_exchanges_desc:0 "냉전이 시작되면서, 제국과 미국 사이의 스파이 활동과 전복 행위가 증가한 것은 당연한 것이였습니다. 우리가 이제 미국과의 '데탕트'를 더 오랫동안 지속하기 위해 노력할 때, 보어만은 공공의 노력뿐만 아니라, 배후에서 서로의 정보기관과의 관계를 증진시킬 것을 제안했습니다. 양측이 간첩죄로 억류된 수십 명의 시민들을 억류하고 있는 가운데, 우리는 그들과 거래해, 모두를 집으로 데려오기 위한 '첩보원 거래'를 제안할 때가 되었습니다."
 GER_recognize_pacific_claims:0 "태평양 영유권 인지"
 GER_recognize_pacific_claims_desc:0 "미국 정부로부터 진정한 신뢰를 얻을 수 있는 유일한 방법은 제2차 세계대전 동안 일본에 빼앗긴 태평양 지역에 대한 그들의 영유권 주장을 공식적으로 인정하는 것입니다. 공식적으로 이러한 주장을 인정함으로서, 양국간의 관계를 신속하게 개선하고, 일본에 대한 우리의 입장을 분명히 할 수 있는 길을 열어줄 것입니다."
 GER_spheres_of_influence:0 "영향권"
 GER_spheres_of_influence_desc:0 "보어만이 제안한 핵심 사항은 아직 극비사항으로 분류되어 있습니다. 우리는 우리의 새로운 대서양 친구들과의 비밀스러운 고위급 회담에서, 우리는 두 나라 사이의 공식적인 영역을 결정했습니다. 이 결정된 사항으로 두 나라 사이에 미래의 분쟁 가능성을 획기적으로 줄일 수 있을 것이고, 일본을 억제하는 데 더 큰 초점을 맞출 수 있을 것입니다. 물론, 미래에 우리가 서로의 영역을 존중하지 못할 때가 분명히 있을 것이지만, 적어도 지금은 두 나라 사이의 평화를 보장하기 위한 중요한 역할로 남아있을 것입니다."
 GER_a_stranger_in_a_strange_land:0 "낯선 땅의 낯선 사람"
 GER_a_stranger_in_a_strange_land_desc:0 "전 세계적으로 독일-미국 관계의 개선이 주시되고 있는 가운데, 미국과 제국의 시민들은 모두 이 '데탕트'가 계속되고 있던 냉랭한 분위기를 따뜻한 분위기로 이어지기를 바라고 있습니다. 전 세계가 지켜보는 가운데, 우리는 이제 가장 획기적인 외교행보에 착수할 것입니다. 우리는 이제 가장 획기적인 외교 행보에 착수할 것이며, 제국의 최고 권력자인 마르틴 보어만이 총통을 대신하여, 미국에 국빈 자격으로서 방문할 것입니다. 우리는 두 강대국 사이의 따뜻한 관계를 유지하는 데 성의를 보일 것입니다."
 GER_convene_the_reichstag:0 "라이히스탁 소집"
 GER_convene_the_reichstag_desc:0 "오늘 우리는 대게르만국 역사에 또 하나의 이정표를 세웠습니다. 1962년, 위대한 기념식인 라이히스탁의 연례 개막식은 독일 총통의 연설을 듣기 위해, 제국 외 아인하이츠팍트 전역에서 모인 사람들로 인해, 역대 개막식 중 가장 웅장한 행사로 기록되었습니다."
 GER_approve_the_budget:0 "예산 승인"
 GER_approve_the_budget_desc:0 "지난 10년 동안 대게르만국은 유감스럽게도 재정적인 어려움을 겪어왔지만, 이제 우리의 경제 문제는 대부분 안정되었습니다. 다만 제국을 위한 예산에 대한 재정 배분 같은 다소 단조로운 일이 남아있습니다. 총통의 1000년 예언은 고사하고, 제국이 적어도 1년은 더 살아남으려면, 반드시 해야 할 일입니다."
 GER_guide_the_party:0 "당을 이끌어라"
 GER_guide_the_party_desc:0 "대게르만국이 제국에서 진정한 정치적 안정을 유지하기 위해, 우리는 의회가 파벌주의로 분열되는 것을 용납할 수 없습니다. 따라서 (항상 그랬듯이) 우리는 의회 내의 당원들에게 라이히스탁에 상정할 사안에 대해 투표하는 방법과 수용 가능한 입장이 무엇인지에 대해 지도할 수 밖에 없습니다. 총통과 당의 의지에 의해 허가된 것 이외의 이상을 추구하는 것은 조국을 불안정하게 만들 수 있기 때문입니다."
 GER_a_bridge_too_far:0 "머나먼 다리"
 GER_a_bridge_too_far_desc:0 "조국이 수개월 동안 시위하는 젊은이들에 의해 시달려온 반면, 시위는 이제 좀처럼 통제 할 수 없게 되었습니다. 현재 독일 전역과 수도를 가로지르는 주요 다리 위주로 대규모의 시위가 지속되고 있습니다. 우리 국가에 불안정과 퇴폐를 불러오기만 하는 이 사회의 불량한 요소들에게 어떤 정책을 취해야 할지를 결정해야 할 때가 왔습니다."
 GER_a_war_of_attrition:0 "소모전"
 GER_a_war_of_attrition_desc:0 "제국의 거리를 '광신자'들의 피로 붉게 물든다면, 세상이 우리를 나쁘게 볼 수 있습니다. 우리는 학생들의 시위를 그저 '소모전'으로 대응함으로서, 젊은이들은 기다림에 지쳐 결국 그들의 기숙사로 돌아가, 조국과 총통만을 섬기는 어른들의 삶으로 변해갈 것입니다. 지금까지 그래왔고, 앞으로도 그래왔으니까요"
 GER_expand_the_orpo:0 "질서경찰 확대"
 GER_expand_the_orpo_desc:0 "우리는 시위를 진압했지만, 여전히 주의를 기울어야 한다는 큰 교훈을 얻었습니다. 불성실하고 동요해대는 젊은이들의 유혈사태와 잠재적 혁명을 피하기 위해, 인정받은 경찰력인 질서경찰(Orpo)을 확충하는 데 투자하는 것이 최선입니다. 불성실한 학생 계층에 대한 미래의 적대적 행동을 효율적이고, 효과적으로 진압하기 위해 제국의 경찰력을 더욱 확정함으로서, 우리는 미래의 안정을 보장할 수 있고, 이들에 대한 통제권을 군부나 SS에 넘겨달라는 어떠한 요구를 막을 수 있습니다."
 GER_send_in_heydrich:0 "하이드리히를 보내라"
 GER_send_in_heydrich_desc:0 "학생 시위자들이 우리의 내부 안정과 세계무대에서 제국의 존립에 매우 실질적인 위협을 가한다는 것은 우리 정부에게 분명한 사실로 다가왔고, 이들을 완전히 제거해야 한다는 것이 분명해졌습니다. 주요 도시를 점령하고, 당사를 공격하고, 질서경찰을 폭행하고, 대규모 혼란을 초래한 시위자들은 제국 전역에서 우리와 맞서는 파르티잔들과 거의 다르지 않다는 것을 증명했습니다. 그들에 대한 우리의 입장을 분명히하고, 그들의 활동을 분산시키기 위해 우리들의 전문대를 파견할 때가 왔습니다. 그것은 바로 하이드리히와 그의 친위대 입니다."
 GER_ss_scapegoats:0 "SS 희생양"
 GER_ss_scapegoats_desc:0 "SS는 신속하고 능률적이며 잔혹함으로 시위를 분산시켰지만, 독일 젊은이들의 피로 얼룩진 거리를 보게 되었습니다. 국내외를 비롯해 책임을 묻는 사람이 많는 상황에서, 우리는 그 책임을 SS의 어깨에 지울 수 있습니다. 조작된 서류와 강압적인 증언으로, 우리는 지나치게 열성적인 SS 장교들에게 책임을 돌릴 수 있습니다. 그 결과 정부의 알벽을 다소 완화하는 동시에, 몇몇 SS 인사들을 조기 퇴직시키게 되겠지만, 하이드리히가 이러한 움직임에 좋은 반응을 보일 것 같진 않습니다."
 GER_pakt_wargames:0 "팍트 워게임"
 GER_pakt_wargames_desc:0 "냉전은 말 그대로 차갑기는 하지만 대독일국 상류층 사이에는 아직까지 '열전'의 위협이 사라지지 않았으므로 우리는 즉각 무력충돌에 대비해야 합니다. 따라서 우리의 적과 새로운 큰 분쟁을 준비하고 유럽을 지키기 위해서는 팍트 워게임을 해야 합니다. 이 군사 훈련은 그 범위만으로도 엄청나게 광범위해 팍트 전역에서 최소 수백만명의 군인들이 이 집중적인 워게임에 참여하며, 이 넓은 세계에 대독일국과 그 동맹국들 사이 형제애와 동지애를 보여줌과 동시에 강력한 메시지를 어필할 것입니다."
 GER_reinforce_the_east:0 "동부 강화"
 GER_reinforce_the_east_desc:0 "동부는 우리의 가장 위대한 업적이자 가장 거대한 실패이기도 합니다. 우리는 바르바로사 작전을 통해 소비에트 곰을 무찔렀다고 생각했지만, 그 곰은 불과 10년도 되지 않아 우리를 A-A 선에서 몰아냈습니다. 서러시아 전쟁의 재앙이 닥친 이후 모스코비옌이란 이름의 동쪽의 국가판무관부는 라이히의 국경을 넘나들어 정착민들을 학살하고 집집마다 돌아다니며 훔칠 수 있는 것들을 전부 약탈해다니는 등 타락한 침략자들의 손에 고통받고 있습니다. 총통께 있어 동부 지역은 현재 라이히에게 전략적으로 가장 중요한 지역이며 러시아의 침략에 맞서 방비를 강화해야 하는 것은 확실해 보입니다."
 GER_refocus_the_bombings:0 "폭격 재검토"
 GER_refocus_the_bombings_desc:0 "루프트바페는 그 모든 영광에도 불구하고 순전히 무능 때문에 지난 10여년간 무작위적으로 선택한 러시아의 목표물에 대한 융단폭격만을 해왔으며 종종 전략적 혹은 전술적 가치가 전혀 없는 목표물에 대해서도 그래왔습니다. 알량한 이익을 위해 가치없는 불필요한 목표물에 귀중한 포탄을 버리는 짓을 더 이상 하지 말고 우리는 루프트바페에게 서러시아 혁명전선에 대항할 새로운 폭격 전략을 수립해 짜야 합니다. 우리의 공군력을 보다 적합한 목표물에 다시 집중시켜 동쪽에서 아직까지 불안한 우리 위치를 확고히 하는 방향으로 나아갈 수 있을 것입니다."
 GER_the_kasche_question:0 "카셰 문제"
 GER_the_kasche_question_desc:0 "모스코비옌 국가판무관부의 악명높은 '자유주의적'이고 무관심한 국가판무관인 지크프리트 카셰는 오랫 동안 우리 편 안의 골칫거리였습니다. 필수적인 독일화 할당량 달성을 포기하고 타락한 슬라브 원주민들이 전례 없는 규모로 모스코비옌 정부에 들어가는 것을 허락해버리며 아리안 정권의 순수성을 어지럽히고 있으며, 동방을 지키기 위해서는 이런 카슈 문제에 답해야 합니다. 카셰 국가판무관은 상당한 수준으로 지역을 안정시키긴 했지만 카셰 대신 국가사회주의에 더욱 열성적인 사람을 놓으면 동방에서 게르마니아의 권위를 다시 되찾을 수 있을 것입니다."
 GER_ss_border_guards:0 "SS 국경수비대"
 GER_ss_border_guards_desc:0 "모스코비옌의 동쪽 국경은 라이히 전체에서 가장 위험한 배치지임이 틀림없습니다. 광대하고 거친 지형에 무서운 눈폭풍과 파괴적인 진흙뻘이 국경을 넘는 약탈자와 소련 파르티잔과 함께 공격을 가하고 있습니다. 솔직히 말하자면 전방은 정말 끔찍하고 기존의 국경수비대는 임무를 수행할 능력이 거의 없습니다. 이처럼 SS가 국경 보호에 더 큰 역할을 해야 한다는 새로운 제안이 육군 내에 제시되었습니다. 우리의 대파르티잔 진압군을 라이히의 가장 불안정한 지역에 투입하는 것이 가장 더없이 적합합니다. 또한 SS의 투입으로 우리의 젊은 독일군 사병 사상자 대신 SS의 사상자로 바꿀 수 있다면 우리는 더 이상 눈물을 흘리지 않아도 될 것입니다."
 GER_the_southern_threat:0 "남쪽의 위협"
 GER_the_southern_threat_desc:0 "남유럽은 우리의 가장 크디 큰 외교적 실패입니다. 독일과 이탈리아의 군사 동맹은 흔들리지 않던 영국과 프랑스 제국을 상대로 놀라운 승리를 거두었지만 이후 우리나라와 이탈리아 왕국 사이 관계는 붕괴되었습니다. 반역자 무솔리니는 사랑스러운 총통의 등을 칼로 찔러 팍트를 버리고 수천 명의 퇴폐적인 운터멘쉬를 끌어안았습니다. 이후 이베리아 연합과 터키와 함께 트리움비라투스 동맹을 세우며 남쪽에서의 상황이 유럽 대륙에서 가장 주요한 독일에 반대하는 위협을 가하고 있습니다. 서러시아 전쟁 이후 동쪽에서 소련의 위협이 분쇄됨에 따라 우리는 이제 남쪽의 위협에 대응하는 것에 초점을 맞춰야 합니다."
 GER_the_balkan_bulwark:0 "발칸 방어구"
 GER_the_balkan_bulwark_desc:0 "형편 없는 이탈리아인들이 우리 손에서 크로아티아를 빼앗아갔지만, 조국은 감사하게도 여전히 세르비아와 불가리아를 우리 영향 하에 두고 있으며 두 국가는 모두 팍트 내의 열성적인 지지국입니다. 하지만 발칸반도 내에서 우리의 이해관계는 의심의 여지 없이 완전하게 확보되어야 하며 이 지역에서 터키와 이탈리아의 영향력과 제대로 맞서 싸워 트리움비라투스와의 전쟁 시기에도 계속해서 우리가 확실하게 확보하고 있어야 합니다. 이는 발칸반도 지역에서 우리의 최우선 과제임이 틀림없습니다."
 GER_expand_the_gebirgsjager:0 "산악엽병 확대"
 GER_expand_the_gebirgsjager_desc:0 "독일의 정예 산악부대인 산악엽병은 우리 남쪽에서 독일-이탈리아 분쟁이 발생할 때 가장 결정적인 존재가 될 것입니다. 알프스 산맥에서 가장 치열한 전투가 일어날텐데 알프스 산맥에서의 전투는 매우 고될 것이며 알프스에서는 우리 군대가 계속해서 불리할 것입니다. 이러한 만일의 사태에 대비해 독일 국방군 최고사령부는 권위 있는 산악 정예병들이 분쟁에서 매우 귀할 것이라고 판단하였고 산악 정예병의 규모를 대폭 확충할 것을 제안했습니다."
 GER_find_their_lepidus:0 "그들 안의 레피두스 찾기"
 GER_find_their_lepidus_desc:0 "겉으로 보기에는 트리움비라투스가 단결되어 있고 부인할 수 없을 정도로 강력한 외교군사적 동맹으로 보이지만, 진정한 현실은 우리가 확신하는 바 속안이 완전히 썩어 있습니다. 우리의 외교 및 정보망을 통해 트리움비라투스 국가들이 전부 서로 상대국에 대해 불만과 불신을 품고 있다는 것은 확실해 보입니다. 그러면 세 강대국 중 한 국가는 더욱 강하고 영향력 높은 상대국보다 밀려나고 있다고 느끼는 것은 당연할 것입니다. 우리는 단지 이러한 느낌을 받는 국가가 어디인지 정확하게 찝어내고 그들의 불행을 우리에게 유리하게 이용해야 할 때입니다."
 GER_the_eternal_enigma:0 "영원한 에니그마"
 GER_the_eternal_enigma_desc:0 "제2차 세계 대전 기간 독일의 최고 기술자들은 우리의 전설적인 암호화 장치인 에니그마 기계를 발명하였으며 여기서 나온 군사 암호들은 해독되지 않았습니다. 이 기계는 매우 성공적이였으며 대체 불가능한 상황으로 인해 오늘날까지 독일 국방군 내에서 매우 광범위하게 사용하고 있습니다. 하지만 현재 사용하고 있는 기계는 매우 구식이며 새로운 컴퓨터 소프트웨어는 현재의 에니그마를 완전히 퇴물로 만들어 버릴 정도로 점점 발전하고 있습니다. 그러므로 현대 시대에 우리의 기밀을 안전하게 지키기 위해 새롭고 훨씬 발전된 에니그마를 개발해야 합니다."
 
 ##Bormann Successor
 GER_bormann:0 "보수파"
 GER_bormann_desc:0 "총통이 당수부장 마르틴 보어만을 자신의 후계자로 선언함에 따라 독일 국민 대다수는 독일국의 안정된 미래를 꿈꾸고 있습니다. 확고한 보수주의자인 헤르만 씨는 가장 논란이 적은 선택이며 당과 시민들 모두로부터 확고한 지지를 얻어내었습니다. 이들은 더욱 보수적인 성향으로 나가야지만 라이히와 국가사회주의 이념이 살아남을 수 있다고 믿고 있습니다."
 GER_present_the_alternative:0 "대안 제시"
 GER_present_the_alternative_desc:0 "그의 반대파들과는 달리, 당수부장 마르틴 보어만은 대체로 실용적인 국가사회주의자로 간주되며, 보수적이면서도 이성적으로 분별할 수 있고 단순히 반대파를 분열시키고 흐트러놓기 보다는 우리 사회에서 보다 개혁적인 요소와 협상할 수 있는 사람입니다.\n\n보어만 씨는 처음부터 끝까지 나치지만 실용적인 사람입니다. 그는 바보가 아니며, 독일 사회의 거의 모든 입장의 사람과 일할 수 있고 다른 경쟁자들과는 전혀 다릅니다."
 GER_secure_the_party:0 "당 확보"
 GER_secure_the_party_desc:0 "대독일국을 잘 통치하기 위해서는 먼저 국가 기구를 확보하는데 중요한 국가사회주의 독일 노동자당을 정복해야 합니다. 총통 히틀러가 노동자당의 수장이라면, 당수부장 보어만은 그의 유명한 두뇌입니다. 하지만 당 내에서 보어만은 강력한 영향을 지니고 있음에도 불구하고 정적들이 지속적으로 보어만을 공격하고 있으며 NSDAP를 하나로 통합하기 위해서는 당수부장이 이 문제를 해결해야 합니다."
 GER_expose_speers_hypocrisy:0 "슈페어의 위선적인 면 노출"
 GER_expose_speers_hypocrisy_desc:0 "총통의 가장 가까운 친구이자 경제부 장관을 지내고 있는 알베르트 슈페어는 NSDAP 내에서 최근 몇 년간 개혁파의 주요 지지자로 활동하고 있습니다. 하지만 슈페어 그 자신은 대독일국 국경 안에서 가장 많은 거짓말을 치는 사람이고 위선자일 가능성이 높습니다. 제2차 세계 대전 당시 군수 및 전시생산부 장관을 맡았던 슈페어는 현재의 '노예 경제' 체제를 제일 먼저 도입한 일명 '건국의 아버지'임에도 불구하고 지금 와서는 이 제도를 스스로 경멸스럽다고 말하고 있습니다. 당과 대중 모두 독일 '노예 경제'의 진정한 배후가 누구인지를 알아야 할 때입니다."
 GER_remind_them_of_heydrichs_bloodlust:0 "하이드리히의 살인광 기질을 상기시키기"
 GER_remind_them_of_heydrichs_bloodlust_desc:0 "'금발의 야수'는 폭력과 피를 갈망하고 있습니다. 이것이 바로 하이드리히 그가 살아남기 위해 행동하는 방식입니다. 힘러의 '제자'인 SS국가지도자 라인하르트 하이드리히는 두려운 슈츠슈타펠(SS) 독일 지부의 지도자입니다. 제2차 세계 대전 기간 동안 하이드리히 씨는 남성, 여성, 어린이를 가리지 않는 사이코패스 도살자라는 이름으로 널리 알려졌습니다. 우리는 당과 대중들에게 하이드리히의 만족할 줄 모르는 피에 대한 열망과 노골적이고 잔혹한 비인간성을 상기시켜줄 의무가 있습니다. 하이드리히의 지도 아래에 있는 라이히는 세계적인 초강대국이라기보다는 거대한 "죽음의 공장"을 더 닮을 것입니다."
 GER_challenge_gorings_competence:0 "괴링의 역량에 도전하기"

It has been decided that to best check Göring's influence, you must neuter his pride and joy - the Luftwaffe. As a result we will defund the Luftwaffe, keeping them short of fuel and restricting the missions they can fly, which effect's Göring's power.

 GER_pressure_the_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine is notorious as being the least political of the three branches of the Wehrmacht, yet also tends to be the most pro-Speer branch. Due to both reasons, it's where the SS has the least influence.

 GER_end_travel_restrictions:0 "End Travel Restrictions"
 GER_end_travel_restrictions_desc:0 "To truly improve German-Burgundian relations, we must end all draconian restrictions placed upon the nation over the past several years. The most glaring restriction is probably the odd travel restrictions between the Reich and her western puppet - restricting who can rightfully enter Himmler's kingdom.

The time has come to make history once more. When we enact Operation Sealion II, foggy Albion will fall to the might of the Wehrmacht and once again enter the fold of the Pakt.

One on hand, London will be the most fortified city in the entire country; on the other, an invasion through the Thames will take the English by complete surprise, and claiming the capital city so early could see this unruly nation capitulate within weeks.

We shall contact and order these men – as well as other underground pro-German cells – to rise up against their new degenerate leadership as soon as possible.\n\nNo amount of fervour can help these weak remnants perform a coup, of course, but the government's resources and attention being dispersed throughout the country by these distractions should benefit us greatly."

This matters not. The longer the enemy tries to hold out against us, the longer they shall suffer the ferocity of our flying aces.

Under Franco, the nation has continued much as it always has, putting down leftist rebels and continuing to rally around its monarchy. With both Portugal and Spain fascist and weaker than their neighbors, the two countries began to drift closer and closer until German sabre rattling caused both to form a permanent alliance and, eventually, unify.\n\nIn Italy, Mussolini and Hitler split in anger as the German-caused 48 Crash dragged Italy down with it. In a move against the Reich, the Italians began to welcome the many groups that Hitler sought to remove, and parts of Italy remain a bustling cultural hodgepodge filled with refugees from across Europe, a continuing source of strife between Germany and Italy. Now, Italo Balbo rules Italy, and he struggles to maintain Italy both as a European power and as the master of a colonial empire.\n\nJapan has grown considerably, and has begun to rise past the Reich in power and prestige. Japan has the largest population of any nation on Earth, and also the most powerful industry, but no longer maintains ties to Germany, sitting opposed to the Reich. The two now sit locked in cold war, both armed with nuclear weapons and both not powerful enough to want to risk war with the other, though warhawks in both camps openly wish for a beginning of hostilities to finally end the question of which is the strongest.\n\nMeanwhile in America, the collapse of the Democratic party in WW2 brought forth the revival of the Democrat-Republican party, who now sit opposed to the National Popular Front, a party of progressives and the remnantsremnants of the American Socialist Party that over the years has becoming increasingly influenced by National Socialist ideology and rhetoric. The NPF's takeover of old Democratic party infastructure has brought it to the national stage, and they now challenge the Democrat-Republican party for the White House. A portion of the NPF is funded by the Reich, who hopes to put the party in power and gain an ally to tip the balance against Japan. For now, however, the Democrat-Republicans maintain neutrality and an alliance of the remains of the Commonwealth, and stands opposed to both Germany and Japan, the three locked in cold war."

 reich.7.d_goering:0 "With the Reichstag in crisis and the world watching, the Führer has announced today that Hermann Göring would succeed him as the leader of the Reich. An ardent supporter of Hitler's from his earliest days, Göring has received not only support from the Nazi oldguard but also much of the Wehrmacht, namely the Heer, whose leaders hope Göring will strengthen the Reich against Japan and also among the airforce, whom with Göring served under during the war. Moderates and liberals, however, have taken offense to the appointment, most wishing to find some peaceful solution to the crisis with Japan, which they fear Göring will fail to deliver. In addition, Göring has some breadth of support in the older population of the Reich, more than at least Speer and Heydrich can say.\n\nEven with this support, however, Göring remains standing on a rocky foundation. Much of the Reich has outright refused to accept the nomination, and Speer, Bormann and Heydrich have all refused to rescind their bids. Many fear war, both inside the Reich, and without. To his credit, Bormann has assured diplomats and party officials that his response will be measured and approrpriate for the situation, for the Reich's enemies abroad and for the traitors inside, but his assurances, and his dogged refusal to outright deny the possibility of another world war, has done little to calm the Reichstag or the many protesters who have seen a marked increase in participation. The Japanese reaction is perhaps most telling of all, as they have mobilized several fleets in response.\n\nThe oddest support, however, comes from Himmler, who, while not outright supporting Göring, and still pushing Heydrich as his own candidate, has called him a "Strong man, the sort that the Reich may need in these times."

While a highly controversial choice, Speer has gained the support of a large swathe of left leaning members of the Reichstag, as well as the peace faction, who wishes to avoid war with Japan at all costs. Speer has announced his hopes to bring the Reich forward into the future, and has assured the German people that he will personally ensure the ailing infastructure and failing economy is brought back from ruin. The various student protesters are hopeful that Speer will prove an adequate inroad to the future.\n\nHowever, this news has been less well received by Speer many enemies, most notably Bormann, Göring and Heydrich, all of whom still contest Speer's claim to the position. The military in particular has taken the news poorly, Wehrmacht command and various hardliners in the Reichstag wanting a strong response to Japanese aggression, which Speer seems hesitant to give. Most worrying of all, perhaps, is Himmler, who has vowed to ensure the Reich remains true to the ideals it was founded on, whether its own Führer agrees or not.\n\nInternational observers are generally hopeful Speer might bring peace to a world desperately praying for it. Despite Burgundian hostilities, support has come from the diplomats of the United States and its allies, as well as several members of the former Soviet Union. Japan, however, has, while congratulating Speer, begun taking the chance to posture anew, already testing the future Führer, and the various minor members of the German Einheitspakt have taken the chance to begin pushing for further independence."

Japan has the largest population of any nation on Earth, and also the most powerful industry, but no longer maintains ties to Germany, sitting opposed to the Reich. The two now sit locked in cold war, both armed with nuclear weapons and both not powerful enough to want to risk war with the other, though war hawks in both camps openly wish for a beginning of hostilities to finally end the question of which is the strongest.\n\nMeanwhile in America, the collapse of the Democratic party in WW2 brought forth the revival of the Democrat-Republican party, who now sit opposed to the National Popular Front, a party of progressives and the remnants of the American Socialist Party that over the years has becoming increasingly influenced by National Socialist ideology and rhetoric. The NPF's takeover of old Democratic party infrastructure has brought it to the national stage, and they now challenge the Democrat-Republican party for the White House.

 ### Schoerner Proposal Chain ###
 reich_chain.0.t: "쇠르너의 제안"
 reich_chain.0.d: "Today, Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner approached the government with a proposal. This proposal consisted on increasing the already bloated military budget as well as reinstating the draft for German males. Although some members of the government believe this could help in the future, this proposal has some immediate problems to it.\n\nFirst off, even though our economy is the strongest, increasing the military budget would probably put our economy under harsh pressure, as a lot of our money already goes to the military and the rest is used to keep the Reich afloat.\n\nFurthermore, reinstating the draft would mean bringing in thousands upon thousands of young German students who hold less-than-ideal opinions on the Reich and its government, potentially making them more trouble than they would be worth.\n\nSchörner is very enthusiastic about his proposal and so are some very influential people in the government, but others want to reject him, while others still believe ignoring Schörner is the best way to shut him up. What will we do?"
 reich_chain.0.a: "Just ignore it and hope he goes away"
 reich_chain.0.b: "Reject the proposal."
 reich_chain.0.c: "Accept the proposal! A genius idea!"

 reich_chain.1.t: "Schörner has been ignored"
 reich_chain.1.d: "After much debating, the government has decided to just ignore Schörner and let his proposal quietly fade away. Hardly an easy task, seeing how he went around trying to convince every official he could meet to support his proposal and clinging onto every tiny passage of the German law in hopes that one could help him get his proposal passed. At the end, he left with his proposal unapproved, feeling disappointed and bitter that none would listen to him."
 reich_chain.1.a: "A shame, but it was the best alternative."

 reich_chain.2.t: "The Missing Reichsmarks"
 reich_chain.2.d: "Over the past several weeks, reports have been trickling in over certain... discrepancies in Wehrmacht equipment inventories. Requests for rifles placed by dissolved squadrons, ammunition ordered by retired officers, uniforms requisitioned for fictional soldiers, and in one case, three trucks rented by a dead man from a motor pool. These events seem completely sporadic and isolated on their own, but this is far too widespread and well-coordinated to be a series of coincidences.\n\nA cursory investigation by our accountants also found thousands - no, millions - of Reichsmarks being siphoned out of all branches of the Wehrmacht through fake operation budgets, accounting 'errors,' and every other means of cooking the books known to man. Both the Gestapo and Abwehr, in a rare moment of unity, have both verified it, and even suggested they're from the same source. One thing has become disturbingly clear: this is is military embezzlement on a scale hitherto unknown in the Heer's history.\n\nThe Führer is understandably furious at the news, and he demands that someone, anyone, be sent to investigate this and get to the bottom of it as soon as possible."
 reich_chain.2.a: "Have the SS-RHSA investigate it, they have yet to fail us."
 reich_chain.2.b: "Send in the Feldjägerkorps, they can be trusted."
 
 #### SS Investigation Path
 reich_chain.3.t: "An investigation in the Wehrmacht"
 reich_chain.3.d: "An most fascinating report has come across the Reichsführer-SS's desk, one verified by both the SD and Heydrich personally as being genuine. A suspicious amount of equipment has vanished from Wehrmacht armories across Germany, and for once this has nothing to do with the Waffen-SS's military rivalries or Himmler's personal machinations. Hitler, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to trust the SS-RHSA with leading the investigation and discovering the culprit. Although it would be within our interest to leave the Wehrmacht as weak as possible, this unknown third party may prove a danger to Himmler's plans if allowed to proceed with impunity."
 reich_chain.3.a: "Tell the RHSA to proceed with the investigation."
 reich_chain.3.b: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Sabotage the search."

 reich_chain.4.t: "풀다-라이프치히 선 전투"
 reich_chain.4.d: "The train had left Fulda, filled to the brim with ammunition, guns, bombs and supplies that according to 14th Panzer Division reports do not actually exist. The SS have tracked it and already prepared their blockade, Obersturmführer Hans Sommer and his personal troop rapidly building a blockade and preparing to derail the vehicle and find out who exactly had ordered its departure.\n\nTrees lay across the road, SS soldiers grimly preparing to fire as they waited for the inevitable approach. Slowly, the ground began to shake, and the train reached the bend..."
 reich_chain.4.a: "Take them down!."

 reich_chain.5.t: "The SS Wins"
 reich_chain.5.d: "Half an hour after passing Wildeck, the SS made their move, derailing the train through use of a blockade and explosive charges. A fierce gun battle began within the wreckage, as armed soldiers in unmarked clothing engaged the SS. After nearly an hour of combat, the soldiers are finally wiped out, and the stolen goods found within the ruined train. Unfortunately, however, it seems that the potential leads died with the soldiers. "
 reich_chain.5.a: "We don't care."

 reich_chain.6.t: "The SS Loses - All For Nothing"
 reich_chain.6.d: "Despite the SS blockade, the train managed to break through and carry on towards its destination! The SS, having refused to work with the Wehrmacht on this issue, could not call on any agency to assist them in pursuing the train. Hours later, the SS, after being fought off several times, finally managed to stop the train. However, it was discovered that some time during the chase, it was emptied, with even the crew being missing. The official reports blame SS-Obersturmbannführer Hans Sommer for the SS' failure."
 reich_chain.6.a: "Damned incompetents!"

 reich_chain.7.t: "Have Sommer killed?"
 reich_chain.7.d: "Sommer's failure to stop the train has proven him incompetent and weak, unfit to live in the eyes of Burgundy. However, he can still serve as a visceral cautionary tale. Himmler is presented with the situation, and makes a decision on how to treat him..."
 reich_chain.7.a: "Have him recalled to Burgundy."
 reich_chain.7.b: "Dead men tell no tales."

 reich_chain.8.t: "Sommer is Assassinated!"
 reich_chain.8.d: "It appears that Hans Sommer, commander of the SS on the train expedition, has been killed! His body was found in an SS-RHSA barracks, shot in the head. Despite Himmler ordering Sommer to be recalled to Burgundy, it appears that the Heydrich had other plans. "
 reich_chain.8.a: "Heydrich, a traitor to Himmler?"
 reich_chain.8.b: "His orders were to bring him in alive!"

 reich_chain.9.t: "Sommer is Assassinated!"
 reich_chain.9.d: "It appears that Hans Sommer, commander of the SS on the train expedition, has been killed! His body was found in an SS-RHSA barracks, shot in the head. It is believed that the execution was carried out on Himmler's orders, with the goal of showing the 'decadent' SS-RHSA what the price of failure truly is."
 reich_chain.9.a: "Disturbing."
 reich_chain.9.b: "A job well done."

 reich_chain.10.t: "The SS is Empty-handed"
 reich_chain.10.d: "As it would seem, the SS-RHSA have ultimately failed in their mission, and were not able to locate any clues relating to the recent stockpile disappearances. Their reports from their investigations that they showed to the officials were practically barren, as if the equipment vanished into thin air.\n\nMaybe a bit too barren.\n\nA few men with sharp eyes noticed that the investigation reports were a bit too short, that some evidence was missing, that some assigned investigators didn't arrive at all, and so on. What is, however, even more alarming, is that apparently the Burgundian SS, out of all candidates, is involved!\n\nAfter bringing a few officers and soldiers to common sense,and reminding them who they should serve first and foremost, we have contracted several documents showing various orders and meeting area coordinations, all organized by Burgundy and their vile SS. After intense panic, numerous arrest orders have been given, and much more are to follow."
 reich_chain.10.a: "Traitors! Arrest them!"
 reich_chain.10.b: "Suspicious, but acceptable."

 reich_chain.11.t: "Ghosts"
 reich_chain.11.d: "As if the situation couldn't get worse, behold, as it did. Somehow, the arrest documents on the various SS officers that were given, because of their clear disloyalty towards The Fatherland, have been leaked for all eyes to see. What, of course, wasn't stated, is that these were all rightfully deserved. Mere hours after the files were leaked, a large number of the targeted officers suddenly started to dissapear, or somehow were granted 'political immunity' because of their 'importance to the function of the government'.\n\nIt has been decided that the best outcome will be to sweep it under a rug. After all, we have cut ourselves a large chunk of embarrassment already , as it is now apparent, that we can't keep our own SS loyal."
 reich_chain.11.a: "Fine!"

 #### Feldjagerkorps Investigation Path
 reich_chain.12.t: "A Mysterious Dead End"
 reich_chain.12.d: "The government has decided to send the Feldjägerkorps to investigate this mysterious event. The Feldjägerkorps, however, have put little efforts into this investigation; taking long breaks between sessions and notoriously bringing in fake leads to the table. The agents that are working with them have reported that they have been threatened by the Feldjägerkorps when they did an important discovery to destroy this discovery. They have also said that they have heard Feldjägerkorps say not so nice comments about the Führer.\n\nThe government suspects that this behaviour has a motivation behind it whatever it might be and has decided to investigate the Feldjägerkorps themselves"
 reich_chain.12.a: "That's what they get for being lazy and violent."

 reich_chain.13.t: "The Feldjagerkorps Blame The SS!"
 reich_chain.13.d: "After the Feldjägerkorps showed improper behaviour during the investigation they were assigned to, the government has decided to open up an investigation against them.\n\nThis investigation has reached the conclusion that this behaviour was motivated by the retirement of Schultz, which many of the Wehrmacht believe was forced. Most of the members of the Feldjägerkorps have been interrogated about this and seems pretty surprised about being interrogating, some even saying they couldn't get interrogated.\n\nThose that were interrogated said that the SS was involved although they didn't said what exactly the SS was involved on. At this point this investigation has consumed more resources than it was intended to, so something must be done to close it."
 reich_chain.13.a: "Follow The SS Lead."
 reich_chain.13.b: "Damn It! Scrap the investigation."

 reich_chain.14.t: "The SS Defies!"
 reich_chain.14.d: "After the Feldjägerkorps told us that the SS was involved in... whatever they think they are involved in, the government has started interrogating SS members that may be involved in... the thing.\n\nThe result of this interrogation round has been dissapointing to say the least. We were expecting for someone to say something that would point to the SS and finally close this damned investigation but all the officers that were interrogated said that the SS has nothing to do with this whole thing and that the Feldjagerkorps accusations are nothing but a petty revenge due to the Schulz issue."
 reich_chain.14.a: "Looks like it's a dead end."

 reich_chain.15.t: "The End Of The Feldjägerkorps Investigation"
 reich_chain.15.d: "After much deliberation, it has been decided that the investigation on the Feldjägerkorps is going to be closed. This investigation has been nothing but dead ends and misleading clues and it has consumed more resources than it was expected to. Even though many are unsatisfied by this, it is the only thing we could do if we expected to end the investigation soon and focus our efforts somewhere else."
 reich_chain.15.a: "Let's hope this is the end."

 reich_chain.16.t: "The Calm After The Storm"
 reich_chain.16.d: "Once the investigation ended some expected that the Feldjagerkorps would take matters into their own hands since it seems like they are pretty mad at the SS for what they say was the assassination of Schulz; but it looks like this wasn't the case. Even though there are still tensions between the SS and the Feldjagerkorps, it looks like they will probably fizz out with time and we won't have to deal with any more bloodshed for a while."
 reich_chain.16.a: "We just dodged a bullet."

 reich_chain.17.t: "War On The Streets"
 reich_chain.17.d: "Even though the investigation against them was closed, it looks like the Feldjagerkorps weren't satisfied with that. They have decided to take the matter into their own hands and decided to attack a group of SS officers because the Feldjagerkorps say the SS is at fault for the retirement of Schulz. This has escalated into a full-blown battle between the two that right now doesn't have a clear winner, but with the force the Feldjagerkorps are using, it looks like it won't end in a tie."
 reich_chain.17.a: "What?!"

 ### Feldjagerkrops Win the War Path
 reich_chain.18.t: "The Feldjägerkorps Win The Battle"
 reich_chain.18.d: "After a hard-fought battle between the SS and the Feldjagerkorps, the Feldjagerkorps won even with the odds against them due to the superiority of the SS. After they won, they captured every SS officer that hadn't escaped or died and rounded them up with the intention of executing them on the spot. Thankfully the OrdungPolizei arrived before the Feldjagerkorps could carry out their desires and the situation has calmed a bit."
 reich_chain.18.a: "Arrest the Feldjagerkorps!"
 reich_chain.18.b: "Let it lie like that"

 reich_chain.19.t: "The Feldjägerkorps' Arrest"
 reich_chain.19.d: "The OrdungPolizei decided to arrest the Feldjagerkorps that were in the scene. Some tried to escape while many argued that the OrPo had no authority to arrest them. At the end all of them were arrested and transported to the police station where it's been agreed they will be trialed for this situation. The SS was released and it's expected they will testify in the trial."
 reich_chain.19.a: "Let the trial begin."

 reich_chain.20.t: "·The Feldjägerkorps' Trial"
 reich_chain.20.d: "Today, the trial of the Feldjägerkorps that engaged a group of SS officers in the street was held. It wasn't easy for the judge to proceed since the Feldjägerkorps had attempted to start another battle numerous times while the SS officers were testifying. The trial has been a long one but the judge is now prepared to show his decision..."
 reich_chain.20.a: "Throw the book"
 reich_chain.20.b: "Quietly pass them through."

 reich_chain.21.t: "The Feldjägerkorps' Execution"
 reich_chain.21.d: "The judge has decided to execute the Feldjägerkorps under the charge of subversion. The SS has publicly stated that they are satisfied with this decision with the reasoning that 'it's what the Feldjägerkorps deserved.' Others are not so happy about this decision, most notably Göring, who is furious and believes that this has been a humiliation for the Wehrmacht."
 reich_chain.21.a: "So sad it had to end with blood"

 reich_chain.22.t: "The Feldjägerkorps Go To Prison"
 reich_chain.22.d: "The judge has decided to send the Feldjägerkorps to prison for an indefinate period of time. The SS is furious about this decision and has stated that they deserve no less that the death penalty for attacking a group of innocent SS officers. The Wehrmacht, on the other hand, while believing the Feldjägerkorps should have been freed, have said that they respect the decision. Those that have been punished are already on their way to prison and some think that the SS will not stand for this situation."
 reich_chain.22.a: "Welcome to prison."

 reich_chain.23.t: "Harsh Life In Prison"
 reich_chain.23.d: "It's a widespread rumour that military prisoners have it very tough, but this is only a rumour of course. Anyhow, today all of the Feldjägerkorps that were imprisoned due to their attack on SS officers were found dead in their cells. While no firm explanation has been found, there have been a large number of possible hypothesies for the cause of this event. The current hypothesis is that they all commited suicide during the lights-out period, however this would've very difficult to pull off since they were all kept far away from each other to try and prevent a situation like this. The Wehrmacht has already pressured the government to open an investigation into this event to find out the true cause of this mystery."
 reich_chain.23.a: "Investigate the deaths."

 reich_chain.24.t: "Investigation On The Suicide of the Feldjägerkorps"
 reich_chain.24.d: "After the recent mass suicide by the Feldjägerkorps in prison, an investigation was opened to identify the causes of this incident. There were almost no clues in the cells of the dead and the only lead investigators have found is the fact that most of them had died due to poisoning while a couple of them died of asphyxiation. Each of the deaths by poisoning was by a different poison while no ropes were found on the asphyxiation victims to hang themselves with. The only other clue there is the fact that some guards took the week off due to health problems and were replaced by a group sent from an SS camp, but at the time the suicides happened, records indicate that most guards were on outside patrol."
 reich_chain.24.a: "It was a coordinated suicide. The end."

 reich_chain.25.t: "A Feast For Crows"
 reich_chain.25.d: "After the Feldjägerkorps and the SS were separated and sent their way by the Ordnungspolizei, a new attack has occurred. This time a group of SS officers have attacked the Feldjägerkorps that attacked them previously in a surprise attack, killing most of them in the process. The SS has said that this is what they deserved after attacking them. Now, the Wehrmacht has been demanding in desperation that the government should take action imminently."
 reich_chain.25.a: "I mean..."

 reich_chain.26.t: "Revenge of The Fifty-Five"
 reich_chain.26.d: "It looks like the government simply wasn't fast enough, because another attack has occurred. This time, a group of off-duty Wehrmacht soldiers attacked an SS barracks and burned it to the ground, killing over a dozen SS members during the attack and in the resulting chaos. The Wehrmacht soldiers have stated that this attack was vengeance against the attack that killed around fifty-five members of the Feldjägerkorps the other day. The SS is now pressuring the government to take action against this."
 reich_chain.26.a: "This is getting out of hand"

 reich_chain.27.t: "A Civil War?"
 reich_chain.27.d: "After the so called 'Revenge of The Fifty-Five,' it looks like the SS and Wehrmacht are at each other's throats. If we don't do something soon and decisively side with one of them, more attacks could happen, and the country might be thrown into civil war. If we knew this would happen by sending the Feldjägerkorps to investigate the disappearance of money and guns, we would have probably send the SS to do it instead."
 reich_chain.27.a: "The SS is right"
 reich_chain.27.b: "The Wehrmacht is right"

 reich_chain.28.t: "Ashes"
 reich_chain.28.d: "Apparently, it is not possible for the various armed forces in the Reich to co-exist together for more than five minutes. Today has been in the spirit of murdering each other on sight.\n\nAfter the recent Wehrmacht revenge on the SS, it was clear that they wouldn't just wash it off. Gunshots could be heard today at every large military base; grenades were going off in every city; orders shouted at every corner.\n\nThis madness had to be stopped at once.\n\nIn the end, the government decided to side with the SS forces, to not agitate them further, probably. This apparant show of support has given a boost to SS efforts, as the SS turned out victorious and the Wehrmacht mutiny has been defeated. Of course, this by no means was the end of trouble for The Reichstag. Göring and the Wehrmacht as a whole are absolutely furious that the government prefers some Burgundian lapdogs over Germany's proud sons. The SS is, at least, somewhat pleased with the outcome. The aftermath is however not looking in our favour."
 reich_chain.28.a: "At least it has ended."

 reich_chain.29.t: "Ashes"
 reich_chain.29.d: "The Reich won't get a moment of rest, as it would seem. After the recent revenge of the Wehrmacht on the SS, it seems that both sides are now tired of petty raids and have escalated the conflict.\n\nFighting has broken out across the whole Reich, with the Wehrmacht and the SS attacking each others' outposts and barracks where they can. This crisis has to be stopped before it tears the Reich appart. The Reichstag has, in the end, sided with the Wehrmacht, possibly due to extensive blackmail and threats from Göring.\n\nRegardless, the Wehrmacht has emerged as the victor. What is unfortunate however, is that the consequences can already be seen. The SS are absolutely furious, stating that the Wehrmacht had absolutely no right to massacre their forces. The Wehrmacht itself have been weakened by such unsuspected larger scale conflict. And as if it wasn't enough, we ourselves have been greatly humiliated, by allowing such an event to even happen under our watch."
 reich_chain.29.a: "At least it has ended."

 ###SS Win the War Path
 reich_chain.30.t: "The SS Slaughters the Feldjägerkorps "
 reich_chain.30.d: "Germany was in shock today, as 55 members of the Feldjägerkorps attacked an SS detachment in broad daylight this morning. Relations between the two organisations have never been particularly good, but with the Feldjägers investigating the SS these past few weeks that relationship has deteriorated to a point of crisis. Agents of the Feldjägers attempted to take matters into their own hands today, and went out to arrest several members of the SS. This turned out rather poorly for the Feldjägers, who were slaughtered to the last during an intense battle with the SS. But as the dust settles, it has becomes clear that the German people, and more importantly the Feldjägers, want justice to be enforced on the SS. This would, however, greatly anger the SS. What should we do?"
 reich_chain.30.a: "Arrest the fools, justice shall be enforced!"
 reich_chain.30.b: "Best to let sleeping dogs lie, let them go."

 reich_chain.32.t: "Our men rot in a German cell"
 reich_chain.32.d: "After a squadron of Waffen-SS men were violently set upon by a group of crazed Feldjägers, the German police had the gall to arrest our men for daring to defend themselves! Many in the Wehrmacht - mostly degenerates and sycophants - are calling for the men to be court-martialed on baseless charges of treason, and it seems they're swaying the Führer with their lies. If we want to protect their lives (not to mention make sure confidential military plans stay that way), it would be most advisable to demand their immediate extradition back to the Ordenstaat to be tried by a proper SS court. However, it would risk burning the few bridges we have remaining with the reich_chain."
 reich_chain.32.a: "Our ties with Germany are worth more than a few men."
 reich_chain.32.b: "No man of the SS shall be subject to this farce of justice!"

 ##Refuse Trial Path
 reich_chain.33.t: "Burgundy demands the SS soldiers' extradition"
 reich_chain.33.d: "A scathing telegram arrived from Himmler this morning demanding that the SS soldiers who slaughtered the Feldjägers have all charges of murder downgraded to involuntary manslaughter, all charges of conspiracy or treason be dropped, and that all defendants be immediately extradited to Burgundy for a Waffen-SS court martial. This was followed by a list of veiled threats with varying degrees of subtlety.\n\nOf course, acquiescing to Himmler's demands would all but guarantee that the men responsible for the Feldjägers' murder would walk away scot-free in Burgundy, and would understandably infuriate the families and Wehrmacht superiors of the deceased. Refusing Himmler, however, is a very dangerous game to play, even for those among the most powerful in the Reich..."
 reich_chain.33.a: "Why should we listen to his ravings? The trial goes on!"
 reich_chain.33.b: "Friendship with Burgundy is of the utmost importance, extradite them."

 reich_chain.34.t: "Germany agrees to our demands!"
 reich_chain.34.d: "This morning, a train arrived in Ost-Paris, filled with the valiant SS men imprisoned for defending themselves from the Feldjäger mongrels. They were greeted by the Reichsführer-SS himself on the platform, who gave a brief speech praising their loyalty and bravery in the face of adversity and betrayal. One brief visit to a military tribunal later, and all outlandish charges of murder were quickly dismissed on blatantly obvious grounds of self-defense, and the soldiers were free men once more."
 reich_chain.34.a: "Justice has been served."

 reich_chain.35.t: "Germany refuses our demands!"
 reich_chain.35.d: "As the hours slowly passed by, Germania was silent. No telegrams, no phone calls, no notifications of diplomatic trains arriving, nothing at all. When a telegram finally did arrive from the Führer himself, it was eagerly sent to Himmler. Its contents, however, were far from what he was anticipating: Hitler was chiding Himmler for overstepping his bounds and trying to subvert the law, much like how a parent would scold a child. Göring and the other decadent and corrupt generals' words were as clear as day - they likely wrote the whole thing and simply had the Führer rubber-stamp it for a veneer of legitimacy.\n\nIt seems that politeness and civility have gotten us nowhere, and more... direct action may soon be necessary to help ensure the safety of our imprisoned men."
 reich_chain.35.a: "Well, we can say we tried."
 reich_chain.35.b: "Bring our soldiers home, by any means necessary."

 reich_chain.36.t: "Burgundy acquiesces"
 reich_chain.36.d: "It seems that our forcefulness in the face of adversity has paid off. The ranting from Burgundy seems like it has finally died down, and the trial against the Waffen-SS murderers can proceed as originally intended. Never before has the Wehrmacht high command been so relieved to hear nothing but silence from Himmler."
 reich_chain.36.a: "No news is good news, it seems."

 reich_chain.37.t: "The Waffen-SS attempts to break out their own!"
 reich_chain.37.d: "Due to concerns for their safety and fears of a potential breakout attempt, the Waffen-SS murderers are continually shuffled between various prisons around Germania under heavy guard at random hours. As the prisoners were being transferred between the Karlslust and Spandau prisons in the early hours of the morning, their convoy was blocked by a garbage truck pulling out of an alleyway. Before the convoy could reverse and follow a detour, plainclothes soldiers hiding in alleyways, buildings, and nearby cars suddenly attacked with automatic rifle fire, grenades, and even a panzerfaust. Although eight military police were killed and one of the armored cars was disabled by a grenade, the rest of the convoy narrowly escaped and sped to Spandau prison with no further interruption.\n\nWhen the Wehrmacht secured the scene of the crime, the assailants had already fled, taking their dead and wounded with them. A rifle was left behind: new, military-issue, and manufactured in Burgundy. The SS have categorically denied any involvement in this, but their failure has become common knowledge in Wehrmacht officers' circles."
 reich_chain.37.a: "That's what they get for trying to subvert German justice!"

 reich_chain.38.t: "The Waffen-SS break out their own!"
 reich_chain.38.d: "Due to concerns for their safety and fears of a potential breakout attempt, the Waffen-SS murderers are continually shuffled between various prisons around Germania under heavy guard at random hours. As the prisoners were being transferred between the Karlslust and Spandau prisons in the early hours of the morning, their convoy was blocked by a garbage truck pulling out of an alleyway. Before the convoy could reverse and follow a detour, plainclothes soldiers hiding in alleyways, buildings, and nearby cars suddenly attacked with automatic rifle fire, grenades, and even a panzerfaust. The main and rear cars were both disabled by grenades, and the prisoner transport was quickly overwhelmed by the assailants before radio contact was lost.\n\nWhen the Wehrmacht arrived to secure the scene, they found nearly two dozen Wehrmacht soldiers dead, many seemingly executed point-blank. The attackers had absconded with their wounded and dead, taking the prisoners with them. Although the SS have categorically denied any involvement in this, the Wehrmacht remain unconvinced and demand vengeance."
 reich_chain.38.a: "Damn them! We need to lick our wounds and bide our time..."
 reich_chain.38.b: "Send in the military, I want them found! NOW!"

 reich_chain.39.t: "General Hollidt is on the case!"
 reich_chain.39.d: "Personally selected by the Führer himself, Generaloberst Karl-Adolf Hollidt of the Wehrmacht has been charged with tracking down those responsible for the recent break-out of the SS prisoners with 'every means in the Reich' at his disposal. Already, he has men from the Abwehr going over every single travel itinerary, equipment order, and field report from Germania Division of the Waffen-SS with a fine-toothed comb, in hopes that he could find any information on who could have hired the agents and where they came from."
 reich_chain.39.a: "Good luck, Hollidt, we're all counting on you."

 reich_chain.40.t: "General Hollidt killed!"
 reich_chain.40.d: "As he was driving home from working on the investigation this evening, Generaloberst Karl-Adolf Hollidt was stuck by a drunk truck driver as he passed through an intersection and was pronounced dead on the spot. The truck driver was also found dead at the scene of the crash, seemingly having broken his neck when his seatbelt slipped upward during the impact. Although many within the Wehrmacht are crying foul and scramble to find a suitable replacement candidate to head up the investigation, it seems that the police are content to write this off as a tragic accident."
 reich_chain.40.a: "How incredibly convenient for the SS..."

 reich_chain.41.t: "The Bohemian Connection"
 reich_chain.41.d: "After what initially seemed like fruitlessly digging through SS headquarters' rubbish, one member of Hollidt's investigation stumbled a major lead. A receipt from a Spandau hotel's bar was found, on the tab of one (obviously pseudonymous) 'Hans Schmidt.' A squad of military police quickly went to Schmidt's room, where he immediately took a cyanide pill upon seeing the officers arriving. One of the few survivors of the convoy break-out later identified him as present at the event.\n\nAlthough Schmidt had destroyed any documents concerning his real identity or any SS connections, two papers were recovered: a train ticket to Prague, and papers granting him permission to meet with the reichskommissar of Bohemia-Moravia, Kurt Deleuge."
 reich_chain.41.a: "It seems a holiday to Prague is in order."

 reich_chain.42.t: "The Bohemian Connection has Derailed"
 reich_chain.42.d: "After discovering the potential location of the SS terrorists' cell in Bohemia, Generaloberst Hollidt ordered a squadron of soldiers, analysts, and military police to accompany him in pursuit. However, the investigation would reach a premature end before they could ever arrive.\n\nAs their high-speed train crossed a bridge over the Vltava river en route to Prague, a support column collapsed, sending the train careening into the water. Those who survived the initial impact inevitably drowned when the heavily-armored train quickly sank to the riverbed. An investigation by the Abwehr suggested that the column was destroyed by high-density military-grade explosives, while the Gestapo claims that it was likely done by escaped Polish partisans using stolen mines. Whatever the cause, it seems that the investigation stops here."

 reich_chain.46.t: "Hollidt found gruesomely murdered"
 reich_chain.46.d: "The festivities within the Wehrmacht concerning their recent triumph died down today with the arrival of terribly grisly news. Generaloberst Karl-Adoft Hollidt, leader of the investigation that discovered and crushed the terroristic Waffen-SS cell hiding within the heart of Germany, was found murdered in his home. According to a police report, he was found on his bed, stripped naked, and stabbed numerous times in the torso. Furthermore, it seems that he was castrated (while still alive, according to a coroner) and his genitals were stuffed in his mouth.\n\nThe only possible culprits seem to be another Waffen-SS cell demanding revenge for their destroyed comrades, though they were careful enough to avoid leaving hard evidence. Already, the somber mood within the Wehrmacht's high command is fading, and mourning wails are becoming replaced with calls for retribution."

After all, these are American missiles that could land on English shores, so it is the duty of the Americans to tend to the weeds that they have planted in their garden.\n\nOur second option is to bypass the Americans completely.

Besides nuclear missiles, this would include long and short-range missiles, as well as tactical ones.

At our disposal, there are two plans that we can use to achieve this.\n\nThe first is a plan concocted by Hanz Halder, the former leader of the Cornwall Garrison. His idea is to begin arming and spreading propaganda about the National Front, which should begin causing directed chaos towards disrupting the English economy.\n\nThe second is a plan made by Reinhard Gehlen is to form a shadow government within England by inviting dissenters to coup the government, as well as to infiltrate the government itself, in an attempt to reduce its internal stability.\n\nThe goal of either of these plans is to prepare for a preemptive invasion of England, one that could be achieved with enough speed so that the Americans only figure out that we've occupied their ally by the time we've hit their shores, which should cut them off from doing anything drastic towards us, as by that point, they could only threaten us with nuclear warfare in order to force us off the island."

We shall also begin spreading propaganda about the National Front in any which way we can. A divided English society will serve as a better grounds for an invasion than a united one.\n\nThe second is to use the swelled-up size of the National Front to begin directly attacking into England's industry, sabotaging its economy and temporarily stunning its industrial capacity in hopes that we can both dampen civilian and military output by the time we launch the invasion.\n\nThe third will be composing the invasion force. Although it is tempting to gather any volunteering Englishmen into this new attacking force, Halder has assured us that the English are nothing but fickle creatures who believe they are better off under the American heel.

Schulz claimed that he had misread Querner's insignia, while Querner insists he was told, "I salute men in higher rank, not dogs."\n\nQuerner felt compelled to order Schulz arrested for treason. Both men called for aid, with nearly every Wehrmacht and SS squad in the city scrambled to the scene. For six tense hours, the city square was a showdown between two masses of riflemen while the generals hollered obscenities and accusations of treason from behind the firing lines. It wasn't until a telegram from Germania arrived that threatened to court-martial and hang them both for insubordination appeared, prompting the two to reluctantly order their troops back to their barracks before departing.\n\nMany are relieved that a bloodbath avoided today, but about the next time?"

Cries of "overstepping his bounds," "insubordination," and "high treason" are echoing through the ranks more and more. Even Heydrich has weighed in and condemned Schulz's "disloyalty to the Reich," though many in the Wehrmacht dismiss him as parroting Himmler's paranoid concerns.\n\nSchulz himself has done little to assuage them, defending his case in front of his superiors and insisting that he has acted perfectly within the realm of protocol. Many in the Wehrmacht officer corps see him as a model leader, and bad memories of the SS's abortive coup in the West Russian war are still strong.

Schulz justified his actions by claiming that the Abwehr informed him of a plot against his life by SS agents, although the SS-managed Gestapo has dismissed any evidence of this to be a forgery to justify personal vendettas.\n\nAs a result of this crisis, tensions are running higher than ever. Himmler himself personally called the Reich Chancellery demanding that Schulz be forced out of command, an opinion echoed by Heydrich, Kaltenbrunner, and nearly every officer in the SS chain of command. Something about him must be done."

They all know exactly why Schulz is retiring: the lying rats in the SS have won the ear of the Führer and convinced him that a hero like Schulz is too dangerous to be kept around. And rather than stand by the army that won him all of Europe, Hitler chose the path of least resistance and sent an order from on high that very heavily suggested Schulz consider retirement. For the men of the Wehrmacht, there is now a bit less in Germany worth fighting for."

He left for Rügen on holiday last week, he probably just decided to stay a bit longer Close the window, sweep up the mess, leave a letter for him, and round up the usual suspects.\n\nFor the agents of the Abwehr, however, it was a different story. They knew Schulz and his wife had taken a train back from Rügen - under a false name for their safety, of course - and arrived back home that very night. The utilities truck that was parked a block away for three days had also vanished, and a neighbor swears she saw the house's lights on. All signs point to an SS 'disappearance.' There's no hard evidence - they aren't sloppy enough to leave any - but many in the Wehrmacht see it as fact already. Already, they're baying for blood, demanding justice from both the SS and those in the Führer's administration who undoubtedly wanted this."

A small sea of faces, military and civilian alike, stretch before him.\n\n"These groups masquerade as true Nazis, but they are wolves in lions' pelts! They conspire against the Führer, the Reich, and all we hold dear!" There are half a dozen men in the back behind the cameras, all in black uniforms, staring at him with hatred burning in their eyes.\n\nHe takes another breath to steady his nerves. Now or never.\n\n"These reprehensible rats even go as far to undermine the Wehrmacht and replace it with their bastard paramilitary! We shall not stand for the lies of the SS any longer! Stand with me, true sons of Germany!

 reich_chain.66.desc: "This morning, Generalleutnant Siegfried Schulz of the Wehrmacht left Brunswick in preparation for a military exercise in the city of Schwerin several miles north. Aware of potential threats on his life, he eschewed public transportation and left with a convoy of three armored cars and a handpicked squadron of Wehrmacht soldiers.\n\nHe would never arrive.\n\nAfter two days of searching, one of the armored cars was found in a ditch along a heavily wooded and oft-deserted stretch of Reichsstraße-191 near Suderburg. The car had gone off the road with no sign of sabotage, and all the occupants had died of consistent blunt force trauma. The next day, the remaining two cars were found: one was found burnt out in some woods on the outskirts of Lüneberg, and the other was found at the bottom of the Elbe. There was no trace of any of the occupants, including Schulz. Despite the SS and Gestapo issuing categorical and oddly specific denials of having any role in his disappearance, many of the Wehrmacht's officer corps are crying foul and demanding justice from the Führer."

Among the two thousand guests milling around and sitting at tables were a fair number of diplomats, of both German and foreign extraction. He placed the speech notes on top of the podium with sweaty hands, surveying the room in apprehension. The speech was short and simple, admittedly a little bland. Bormann smiled to himself bitterly. He had never been able to match the striking visual imagery and acerbic wit of Goebbels' writings. At times like these, he almost missed that lecherous little rat.\n\n"Gentlemen," Bormann announced into the microphone, waiting as a blanket of silence gradually fell upon the crowd. "The Führer!" He turned to his right and saluted. The guests followed suit, rising to their feet and saluting to varying degrees of hastiness. Adolf Hitler shuffled towards the podium and grasped it with two trembling hands.\n\n"Recent events may herald a diplomatic shift for the Reich..." Hitler's voice quickly faded away. Bormann's blood ran cold as Hitler looked up and eyed the hall in confusion. "Where... Where is Ernst? He told me he would be here..." Bormann strode over to the podium and placed an arm behind the Führer's back, gently leading him away. The old man's body was violently quivering. "I think... I think I was at your wedding!" Hitler exclaimed loudly, his rasping voice reverberating throughout the hall. Confused murmurs erupted throughout the crowd. "Are you still in the SA?"\n\n"Forgive me, gentlemen!" Walther Hewel exclaimed, swiftly taking the podium as Bormann and Misch led Hitler through the exit. "The Führer was accidentally given my speech. Allow me to continue.

There were only a few dozen people in the crowd, but not a single one was unimportant. Reichsminister Werner Naumann and representatives of the RMVP stood with famous artists and reporters of the state press. Hitler's pompous adjutant Julius Schaub was shooting daggers at Martin Bormann, who was watching the Führer like a hawk. They were all nodding respectfully as Hitler began to discuss the late painter Adolf Wissel, pretending to ignore the two trembling hands thrust awkwardly behind his back. Despite Brandt's severe protestations, Schaub had insisted that Hitler travel to the Führermuseum in Linz to officially open the new art exhibition.\n\n"... including a newly commissioned sculpture of my successor. Now, unfortunately for the young men here today, it is the curse of great artists to die before their time. Adolf Ziegler passed away only a few years ago, and Arno Breker's recent death has wrecked the world of sculpturing immensely." The crowd slowly turned to the left podium where Arno Breker was frozen still, his eyes darting fearfully around the room. Brandt wiped his forehead again with a drenched cloth. "Many of you are too young to remember the days of degenerate art..."\n\nThe Führer trailed off. His whole body suddenly tightened up and he staggered into the right-hand podium. Brandt's blood turned to ice. Hitler's arms violently jerked out and his head snapped forwards, slamming into the marble podium with a sickening crack. A gasp of horror exploded from the audience as the Führer crumpled to the floor, blood pouring from his forehead, arms and legs still writhing. A woman screamed. A man yelled a curse. Rochus Misch was yelling at the crowd to stay back. Bormann rushed forwards and slipped on the blood with a yell, staggering into Schaub. Brandt turned Hitler onto his side and inspected the wound on his forehead. It was just a cut. The doctor shot Schaub a glare as the uproar reached a fevered pitch."

I trust the fresh air of the Berghof is treating him well?" Doctor Brandt replied with the usual pleasantries and assured him of the Führer's good health in medical isolation. "Let's cut to the chase, Doctor. Will the Führer survive?"\n\n"As long as my medical orders are not interrupted by the likes of Julius Schaub," the Doctor spoke after a brief pause, "we should see a turnaround."\n\n"Schaub is a pompous oaf," Bormann said through gritted teeth. "Ignore him and continue your good work. I will be sending a man to deliver reports to the Führer at three in the afternoon on a daily basis. Goodnight." Bormann placed the phone down and took a deep puff of his cigar. It was the burden of great men to suffer for their people. Whether Hitler lived or died, at least he would be privy to the Berghof's beautiful views. Bormann snapped his fingers at the man sitting opposite him. Gerhard Klopfer lifted his head from the pile of documents and straightened his back. "Listen up, Gerhard. I need you to organise a meeting of the Reichstag in one week's time. I'll be giving reassurances to the Party that the Führer is medically fit, while also emphasising the importance of remaining mentally and politically prepared for his sudden passing. I'll also use the opportunity to denounce the reformist and the militarist scum, and to attack Speer and Göring for not attending such an important gathering."\n\n"They won't be attending?" Klopfer raised an eyebrow.\n\n"Not if they're given the wrong date," Bormann grinned. Göring had always been an easy target, and Speer had nowhere to hide now that the Führer was incapacitated.

He was watching the Führer like a hawk, ready to leap forwards in an instant. Despite his deteriorating condition, Hitler had gently asked Brandt if he could maintain his old ritual of strolling to the teahouse on Mooslahnerkopf Hill. Julius Schaub had soon caught wind of this and, despite Brandt's numerous protestations, forced him to adhere to the Führer's orders. That smug sycophant was striding alongside them, inhaling deeply as he basked in the sunlight. Imagining that idiot tripping over and smashing his face upon a rock gave Brandt some modicum of relief.\n\nHitler suddenly halted in his tracks, panting heavily. Brandt dived forwards just in time to catch the old man by the shoulders as he collapsed backwards like a puppet without strings. His face was pale and covered in sweat, and his breathing was raspier than usual. Brandt gently lowered him to the ground and turned him on his side, tearing off his own jacket to place under the Führer's head in anticipation of a seizure. As he suspected, Hitler's body soon began to jerk uncontrollably.\n\n"Don't just stand there!" Brandt shouted at Schaub, who was staring at the two of them in distress. "Get Kempka! Now!" Schaub nodded and raced back the way they had come. After a few minutes, the seizure stopped. Hitler was breathing raggedly, clutching at the dirt beneath his hands. His eyes were filled with tears.\n\nAt last the car arrived. Erich Kempka leapt out of the driver's seat and thrust open the back door.

Even with the Führer away in Bavaria, Bormann did not think twice about slaving away so late into the night.\n\nIt was early in the morning when Gerhard Klopfer entered the room and gave Bormann the harrowing news. Their contact in the Berghof had been in touch. The Führer had slipped into a coma. Sadness and dread swirled in the pit of Bormann's stomach as he sat silently at his desk, ruminating on the future. His Führer was on the cusp of death, and his enemies were not going to sit idly by once this fact reached them. Though Bormann's support base was strong, Göring's militarists would contest his leadership the moment Hitler died. Perhaps if Bormann informed his loyal allies in the Party and the Wehrmacht of Hitler's condition, they would be prepared for any potential conflict? Perhaps if the Reichstag officially declared him as the Führer, he could maintain a strategic position in Germania in the terrifying event of a civil war? The phone's shrill rings snapped Bormann from his thoughts.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice. "Herr Bormann, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"You want me to scapegoat Schaub to protect Doctor Brandt?" Bormann scoffed. "I don't care much for Brandt, but Schaub is a repulsive fucking toad. I'll do it. Tell Göring to do the same. We must focus the public's attention on Herr Schaub."

Now the dreaded moment to step into the light had come.\n\n"You must not tell anyone!" Bormann suddenly snapped, slapping his palm against the table. "The Berghof staff must be silenced. This information cannot be allowed to spread, under any circumstances. The Reichstag must pronounce me as Führer before Göring or any of the others have a chance to intervene."\n\nThe minutes turned into hours. The hours grew into days. Soon, despite his greatest efforts, the rumors had spread throughout the Reich. The Führer was dead. The Reich was officially leaderless.\n\n"What?!" Bormann roared into his phone, shooting to his feet. "They fucking did what?!" He slammed the phone down with a curse and paced the room, rubbing his temples.

"Your hard work will not go unrewarded; I can assure you. Have a good night!" He placed the phone down and strummed his fingers against the desk. The Führer's absence provided an opportunity for further action. If he hosted a military parade and delivered a grand speech glorifying the Wehrmacht, it would satisfy the likes of Schörner and Remer, while also infuriating Bormann and making him look weak and incompetent. Afterwards, he could propose a meeting in the Reichstag, in which he would paint the Führer's secretary as a closet liberal, no better than Speer and his crypto-Bolshevik agitators.

Well, I will send my own man earlier in the day to give you a different report. When Bormann's lackey arrives, I want you to inform him that the Führer is asleep, but you will dutifully pass on the documents when he awakes.

Making Bormann look weak and incompetent was simple; he just needed to ignore any orders directed to him by the Führer's secretary, while strengthening the SS in the process. Göring's faction drew its power from its unity, but a secret brothel recording obtained by the SD would soon change that. The Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Stuckart, one of Göring's closest friends, had been caught on tape explicitly mocking Schörner and Remer, their strongest military allies.\n\nAs for Speer? The SD had also uncovered an illicit affair between one of Speer's reformist technocrats in the Ministry of Economics and a university student with ties to radical liberal movements. Upon the leaking of the scandal, Gestapo agents will waste no time in spreading rumors that this affair is not an isolated incident, and that the relationship between the Party reformists and the liberal students is more than ideological.

Politicians discussed it, medical experts debated it and the common citizen was theorizing about it. The same words were on everyone's lips: The Führer is dead. The excitement that coursed through Heydrich's veins was tinged with a slight sadness. The memories of what Hitler had once been were just as vivid as the memories of what he had become. The degeneration of the Reich could not be rested at the feet of that senile old man, after all. It was the corruption of Bormann, Göring, Speer and many others that destroyed the Fatherland many years ago. Without question, history would recall the Führer as a Great Man of history. As it would for Reinhard Heydrich.\n\nThe minutes turned into hours. The hours grew into days. Soon, the rumors had become fact. The Führer was dead. The Reich was officially leaderless.\n\n"I see," Heydrich muttered into the phone, replying to the voice's claims. He placed the phone down gently, restraining the urge to pound it against the table until it shattered into a million pieces. The Reichstag had just met without inviting the appointed successor. The pestilence infecting the Emergency Council had refused to legally pronounce Heydrich as the new Führer, claiming that now was a time for mourning and not ceremony. Germania had slipped through his fingers, but it mattered little. According to his spies, Göring, Speer and Bormann had already fled the city. There was no time to lose. The road to leadership would be painted red with the blood of his enemies. Extensive military preparations had already been made.\n\nIt was time to fly west."

 hitlerillness.30.desc:0 "Speer's blood was running cold. The dreaded moment had finally arrived. Doctor Brandt had phoned him in the early hours of the morning, claiming that Hitler had fallen into a coma. After an hour of sleepless contemplation, Speer once more wrenched himself out of bed, strode to his study room and plucked up the phone. He needed a talk with the Chief of the Party Chancellery.\n\n"Heil Hitler. Herr Bormann, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor I will remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"Let me guess," Bormann replied after a brief pause. "You want me to condemn him too? Scapegoat him to protect Doctor Brandt?" He scoffed. "I don't care much for Brandt, but Schaub is a repulsive fucking toad. I'll make sure to speak my mind."\n\n"Let Göring know," Speer said, and placed down the phone. A pang of sickness was growing in his stomach. His friend and mentor was on the cusp of death, and his foes were not going to sit idly by once this fact had reached them. He ran a hand through his thinning hair and slowed his breathing. Hitler's current state of health must remain a secret. Only his most loyal supporters in the Party and the Wehrmacht could be informed, to prepare them for any future conflict. He could give some speeches to sway moderate Party comrades, and maybe throw in a few dog whistles to rile up the student movements throughout the Reich. As long as the Reichstag declared him to be the Führer, he could probably maintain a strategic position in Germania in the disastrous event of a civil war."

 hitlerillness.32.desc:0 "Hermann Göring slumped into his chair with a heavy sigh. He glanced out of the window, watching the moon struggle to break free from the dark clouds that swarmed it. His mind was racing, almost as fast as his heart. His spy in the Berghof had reported back grave news, the news he had anticipated for a long time with a mixture of hope and fear. Hitler had fallen into a coma and was unlikely to recover.\n\nNow was not the time to mourn his old friend or celebrate his glorious new future. Now was the time to act. The Führer was on the cusp of death, and Göring's enemies were not going to sit idly by once this fact reached them. He had to ensure they knew nothing about the state of Hitler's health. Only his closest allies in the Wehrmacht and the Party would be informed, to make military preparations for a potential armed struggle. Bormann had rallied most of the conservatives in the Party behind him and provided the greatest threat to Göring's power, although Heydrich's lunatics and Speer's liberals would no doubt exploit any such conflict as well. As long as the Reichstag declared Göring to be the Führer, he would probably be able to maintain a strategic position in Germania in the event of a civil war. He was torn from his thoughts by the shrill ringing of the phone.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice. "Reichsmarschall, I'm sure you would agree that the Führer's absence from the public sphere has not gone unnoticed. Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"Ah, you want me to scapegoat Schaub in order to protect Doctor Brandt?" Göring chuckled. "I'm happy to take any action against that fawning little idiot. Tell Bormann to do the same! We must focus the public's attention on Herr Schaub." And away from Hitler, Göring thought."

The tape soon clicked to an end.\n\nHeydrich took a deep breath and stroked the device, his mind adrift on the violent waves of indecision. The Führer was on the cusp of death, and Speer was doubtless preparing for the inevitable. His clique of degenerates were not the largest threat, of course; Bormann's corruption had brought him much support in the Party, while Göring's pathetic weaknesses were perfect for his militarist puppet masters. The Schutzstaffel had to prepare themselves, both militarily and in mind, for the upcoming war that would tear the Reich asunder and usher in a new age of National Socialism. Even if the Reichstag declared Heydrich to be the Führer, he would never be able to hold on to Germania as a strategic position. Military preparations had to be made without hesitation or delay. He was torn from his thoughts by the ringing of the phone.\n\n"Heil Hitler," came Speer's deep voice.

Doctor Karl Brandt has served Hitler faithfully, and the only thing preventing a faster rate of recovery is Julius Schaub's interference. As the designated successor, you should remove him from his post immediately and publicly condemn him."\n\n"You wish to scapegoat Schaub instead of Brandt?" Heydrich considered for a moment.

reich.600.t:0 "The Brown Eminence"
reich.600.desc:0 "If one were to gaze upon the drab visage of this balding little man, it would be hard to view him as anything more than a stuffy bureaucrat, one single cog in the grand mechanism of the state.\n\nSuch a miscalculation could be a potentially fatal mistake. As Chief of the Party Chancellery and Private Secretary of the Führer, Martin Bormann has climbed the greasy rungs of the NSDAP in silent persistence, asking for neither fame nor excess on any step of his rise to authority.\n\nHis friends and foes alike refer to him mockingly as 'the Brown Eminence'. Such a scatological slur means nothing to Bormann, who cares little for humor and less for personal insults directed towards his character. He is not a man of pomp or ceremony, but of duty and dedication to the Reich. Many would claim he is rarely seen stepping out of the Führer's gradually diminishing shadow – except those who whisper of his visits to beautiful young actresses and models throughout the nation.\n\nAs the new decade rolls on, Martin Bormann continues to stalk the shadowy corridors of power in his ill-fitting suit, further enveloping himself in the mechanisms of the Reich's bureaucratic apparatus. The bizarre contradiction of such a despised man holding such enormous influence betrays a mind dedicated solely to the pursuit of power – whatever the cost may be."

reich.601.t:0 "The Gilded Reichsmarschall"
reich.601.desc:0 "If the Führer is the paternalistic ruler of the German Reich, then Hermann Göring is its popular uncle. Beloved by the civilians for his jolly demeanour and the Wehrmacht for promoting their interests throughout the decades, the Reichsmarschall has always desired to maintain the reputation of a diligent military man, loyal to his Reich and his Führer.\n\nTo believe such a thing would be to downplay the man's ambitions. Having held many illustrious posts, from founder and chief of the Gestapo to the Reich Plenipotentiary of the Four-Year Plan, the aristocratic Göring has developed a lust for power and wealth few could rival. Residing in his enormous Carinhall mansion with his vast collections of outfits, jewellery and artwork (plundered from the Reich's conquests), the Reichsmarschall continues to coalesce as much influence around himself as possible. While not as close to Hitler as he once was, he has acquired relevance by becoming the de facto figurehead of the militarist movement.\n\nSome would argue that Göring is little more than a pompous buffoon, allowing himself to be puppeted by radical forces in the hopes of acquiring even more attention and power. Others would find such a suggestion to be foolish, for Göring has long proven himself to be as manipulatively cunning as he is dedicated. His role in the future of Reich politics remains to be seen."

reich.602.t:0 "The Reichsarchitekt"
reich.602.desc:0 "A figure often overlooked in the convoluted politics of the Reich, Albert Speer is nonetheless one of its key players. Architect by profession, and personal friend of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, Speer was attracted to the future Führer's persuasive dialectic and his great plans for Germany. The attraction was mutual: as soon as Hitler looked at Speer's work, the young architect found himself launched at the forefront of the party leadership, and tasked with designing dozens of public buildings.\n\nThe war changed everything. Speer was appointed Minister for the Armaments during the most difficult time of the conflict, and it was there that a side of his personality made itself even more evident: opportunism. He took the merit for Germany's production surge, but his main contribution to the war effort had been the invention of what would forever change the Reich: slavery. Hundreds of thousands of inferiors and war prisoners toiled and died in the military-industrial complexes, fuelling the German war machine with their lives.\n\nAfter the war, Speer returned to his passion, and single-handedly designed the culmen of the Reich's grandeur. Germania, the new Caput Mundi, was set to overshadow Rome, Paris and all great cities around the world, but then the economy crashed, taking his dreams with it. In a moment of catharsis, he understood that slavery had been among the main reasons for the collapse, and in the most opportunistic of moves, he started speaking against it, asking for reform: as an unwanted consequence, he soon found himself the focal point of a large reformist movement advocating for change. Swept by currents stronger than him, he decided to follow them, desperately hoping that no one would ever discover his mistakes.\n\nFor good or for ill, Albert Speer has, in his own way, reshaped Germany, forever changing both its architectural fashion and its society. He is, and forever will be, the Reichsarchitekt."

reich.603.desc:0 "Formerly the Protektor of Bohemia-Moravia, Director of the SD and one of the principal architects of the Endlösung, the very name Reinhard Heydrich is uttered in fear by German citizens and Slavic slaves alike.\n\nA man of infamously intellectual and cultured sensibilities, the Reichsführer of the German SS hides his insatiably animalistic hunger for power behind a cold sheen of quiet reservation. While his meteoric rise in influence and status throughout the 1930s and 1940s surprised nobody, few could have predicted his ascension to the leadership of the Schutzstaffel would come as a result of Heinrich Himmler's failed coup in the 1950s.\n\nDespite its many fractures, the Party is unified behind its hatred of Heydrich and fear of his SS. Many believe it is only Hitler's respect for 'The Man with the Iron Heart' that enables him to maintain such a position of brutal authority, although others would point to a different source. Heinrich Himmler, tyrannical despot of the mysterious Ordenstaat-Burgund, is theorized by many to be the true power behind the throne.\n\nWhile Heydrich and Himmler have their disagreements, both men advocate the return of 'True National Socialism' – by which they mean an end to the corruption of the Party, and the imposition of a totalitarian state dedicated to the values of the SS. The attempts by Hitler's Inner Circle to reduce the influence of the SS has not been entirely unsuccessful, but as long as Reinhard Heydrich remains to be its leader, it will not dissipate so easily."

reich.604.t:0 "The Gang of Four"
reich.604.desc:0 "The Reich is a granitic edifice, firmly under the Führer's control, and utterly dedicated to the glorification of the German people and National Socialism. This is what the propaganda tells, but in truth, large cracks run throughout the entire façade of this seemingly powerful giant. Both inside and outside the administration, weak voices ask for change, for reform, anything -they say - to stave off the inevitable collapse of Germany's crumbling empire. Among this choir of whispers, four manage to stand out, barely audible in the blaring propaganda: they are the Gang of Four.\n\nKurt Georg Kiesinger is a prominent member of the NSDAP, with deep connection to many organs within the Reich. While charismatic and cautious, his reformist views didn't endear him to the conservative leadership. Ludwig Erhard is an extremely respected - outside of Germany, that is - economist, who had already predicted the economic collapse. Of course, in a modern version of Cassandra's tale, no one listened to him until it was too late, and his vehement criticism earned him many enemies. Helmut Schmidt is an expert diplomat who joined the NSDAP mainly to cover the fact that he hates National Socialism with a vengeance. His ties to the American business would greatly help Germany, if anyone cared to listen to his advice. Henning von Tresckow hails from the ancient Prussian warrior nobility, and is - as expected - a general in the Heer. Disgusted with the state of the Wehrmacht, he wants to reform it along the old Prussian standards, which made him not exactly a friend of the high hierarchies...\n\nEach an expert in his own field, the members of this small group of reformers have put themselves under the wing of Albert Speer to avoid persecution. Even though their relationship with their patron aren't always as idyllic as they would like - mainly because, unlike them, Speer is a convinced nazist - they all depend on each other to protect themselves from the SS, and to plan Germany's future so that it may be better than the present."

reich.606.t:0 "Agent Kleiner Fuchs"
reich.606.desc:0 "Among the many agencies dedicated to rooting out any danger to the Reich's integrity and continued supremacy, none holds so much power as the Abwehr. At the top of such a large and convoluted agency, with tendrils digging deep into all offices and bureaus of the equally large German administration, a single man sits uncontested: his power is enough that he can order death without having to ask for permission, and even the SS must tread carefully within his reach.\n\nReinhard Gehlen, better known as Agent Kleiner Fuchs, is a secretive man, a quality that goes very well with his role. Had it not been so, he would have long since been dead... With cunning and skill, Gehlen rose through the ranks of the Abwehr, making important allies and equally important enemies, but no friends: it's difficult being friends with someone who holds enough evidence against you to send you to the concentration camps for the rest of your life...\n\nAmong the countless agents working under him, one stands out, one he has taken the slightest bit of attachment for. Gerhard Wessel - known in the field as Agent Verfilztes Kätzchen - is a capable officer hailing from the Wehrmacht, and has been Gehlen's protegè for almost a decade, ever since he discovered his ability with analyzing large amounts of complex data, and quickly devising plans and countermeasures: while not the best field agent - something which Gehlen tries every day to change - Wessel possesses both competence and loyalty, a rare combination of qualities these days...\n\nIn a world of shadows, the one who rules over them is in charge, and in the Reich, all shadows, be they large or slim, grey or pitch-black, swear their allegiance to Agent Kleiner Fuchs."

Ever ambitious, Schörner desired nothing less than to be head of the entire Wehrmacht itself! Though a brilliant military man, his skill was not enough; his dreams of promotion were dashed against the rocks of reality by his cataclysmic performance during the West Russian War of the 1950s.\n\nConsidered a failure by many and generally despised by both subordinates and superiors alike, Schörner has nonetheless forged a path as an influential leader in the Reich's Militarist faction, and is considered to be Hermann Göring's number one man. To the likes of Hans Speidel, who he despises, his clique is little more than a psychotic band of sabre-rattlers. To Schörner and his followers, however, they are the saviors of a decaying and dying German; a noble band of warriors demanding greater power for the Wehrmacht and an increased sphere of German influence in Europe and beyond."

A former Hitler Youth leader, the Second World War would see him deployed on nearly every front the Reich fought on. Participating in Poland; France; the Balkans; Remer impressed his superiors during Operation Barbarossa, where he led his own regiment in Ukraine with distinction.\n\nIn the following decade, Remer managed to claw his way to commanding his own corps just in time for the West Russian Revolutionary Front's invasion of RK Moskowein. Again, he led with distinction in the fighting against the Communists. Remer's corps was also instrumental in sabotaging Himmler's coup; he and his men arrested more than their fair share of SS formations when Speidel sent his orders.\n\nRemer has not been sitting idle since then, however. Ferdinand Schörner made his acquaintance with Remer shortly after the market crash of the 50s, and the two aligned thanks to their staunch opposition to any and all military cuts. As of now, Remer acts as Schörner's right hand man for the most militant of the German command staff. Highly intelligent and ambitious, Remer is certainly a man to watch. An opportunist at heart, the role he is yet to play within the Reich is unknown, for better or worse."

reich.72.t:0 "The Adler is Launched!"
reich.72.d:0 "The port city of Wilhelmshaven houses some of the largest - and oldest - shipbuilding facilities in the entire world. Its awe-inspiring drydocks are capable of building nearly anything; everything from corvettes and minesweepers to gigantic battleships have left these docks, even when the idea of a German nation was still a new concept. Karl Dönitz knows the production capabilities of these facilities; as Oberbefehlshaber der Marine, he has seen dozens upon dozens of ships launch over the years, but this is a moment which will go down in history.\n\nToday, the largest and most powerful aircraft carrier of the Kriegsmarine - christened "Adler" by Hitler himself - is finally ready for its maiden voyage, a spectacle that will be broadcasted all over the Reich! Admiral Dönitz knows what remains unspoken: the Adler is not the latest capital ship, but the last for the foreseeable future, as the Reich can no longer afford to build new ships as per the 1958 budget. Funding had been slashed in nearly all sectors; ship maintenance and payrolls are all that the Kreigsmarine will be bankrolling for now.\n\nThe ceremony was lovely, the Führer himself thanked the admiral profusely for his tireless dedication and work, with vague promises spoken about "more funding for the Kriegsmarine soon", something he has done since 1958. Dönitz cermonally nodded when he needed to and offered thanks when appropriate, as he had done dozens of times before. Ever the model military man, he greeted the rest of the Führer's entourage. He shook hands with Martin Bormann first; an upstanding gentleman, really. Next, Albert Speer; an opportunistic Nazi, no more, no less. If Speer was opportunistic, then Dönitz wondered what Göring would be considered; the man was looking surprisingly spry as well. Last but not least, Reinhard Heydrich's cold, clammy hand. A Blond Butcher, and a bastard to boot.\n\nThe Admiral glanced back over at his Führer, who was blabbering to an aide. He was getting old, and old age was not treating him kindly. God help the Reich once Hitler was...\n\nDönitz pushed the thought out of his head. He was a navy man, first and foremost. Let the politics to those four schemers."

Stormtroopers have bullied troops from the regular army out of several armories across Germany, mostly concentrated in the Rhine. Several brawls between them and the Heer have also been reported. The SS are also disrupting flight schedules in order to "screen" pilots and passengers, even from the Luftwaffe! This is a thin veil to harass them, nothing more, and shouldn't be mistaken as anything else.\n\nThey have felt the need to make their presence known to the civilian population as well, carrying out their own investigations of the citizen population. Anything ranging from "foreign spy" to "tax evasion" has been used as an excuse to detain and harass people; they even have the backbone to set up checkpoints with no approval from anyone but themselves, and have been able to freely arrest "suspected Jews and other undesirables," who are more often than not critics of the SS.

Sit-ins have effectively shut down most campuses, and students have taken it upon themselves to block off government and army buildings. Many of the larger gatherings are flat out refusing to disperse, and students at many of the sit-ins refuse to budge. A large crowd of over two hundred people even blocked off an SS barracks! It was a miracle that no one died.\n\nWe need to do something about the student protesters now before the situation spirals out of our hands. One way or another, we need to take action. "

Uneducated Germans are hard pressed to find jobs, forcing them to survive on state welfare. This has made labor involving higher education super competitive, and even our best and biggest struggle to find jobs!\n\nThe situation only worsens year after year, with no solution in sight. There are simply not enough private sector jobs to go around. The German economy needs a major overhaul, with the first being to address the dismissal state of German employment. While we could certainly just conscript more men to drop unemployment or increase benefits and payouts, it may be prudent to start phasing out slave labor and returning these jobs to the civilian sector, even if it is at the expense of the industrialists.

Reactions are mixed; many conservative NSDAP members are disgusted, arguing that women's purity needs to be preserved and that the German woman's purpose is to be a caretaker. Some of the more traditional women wholeheartedly agree, seeing their place in Germany as an essential pillar of the German family. On the flip side, many younger women chaff at the thought of remaining second class citizens in their own country, and demand more freedoms and acceptance from the population at large.

For a while now, the slave population has been slowly but steadily rising, and it is apparent that we now need more living space for the increased number of laborers. The camps are starting to overflow with people, and their living conditions are steadily declining.\n\nAlthough it is inconvenient, something should be done now.

Major corporate interests throughout the country silently consolidated their holdings and bought properties, machinery, and expertise for next to nothing. German citizens were replaced with cheaper slave labor, and their jobs simply never returned. A decade later, wages still haven't returned to their pre-crash levels, even with ten years of inflation for the few that still work.\n\nThe German people yearn for some kind of action; we can not be content to sit and watch our citizens suffer.

After a decade of (relative) peace throughout Germany, the program began to de-militarized. They are now more akin to the American or British scouts than the group of old, though they still honor their material traditions.\n\nWe have on our desks a couple of proposals to mold the Hitlerjugend into something more of our liking.

After the Second World War, plans were put into motion to see the expansion of the Autobahn to all corners of German dominated Europe, from Moscowien to the Gibraltar dam, and everything in between. Ambitious expansions were planned for the booming and growing cities of the Reich, and were proceeding smoothly.\n\nThe great economic crash of the 50's put a quick stop to everything. Funding was massively cut, making the planned expansions simply impossible. The highway has begun to decay from chronic lack of maintenance.\n\nA stack of proposals have been sent over to our desks. The paperwork details plans for a massive works project to begin much needed repairs all throughout the Reich on the Autobahn. Expansion plans for easily congested areas have also been mapped out. We only need to give the okay to begin the work."

reich.616.desc:0 "After the Second World War, the German military bore no rival. Our military spending was second to none, as was our might! We proved the world our strength by accomplishing what many considered impossible; we retained tight control over our conquests, then expanded our empire even more by occupying the entire middle section of the dark continent! Since then, we've spent the better part of two decades crushing army after army of partisans, as well as a Russian invasion.\n\nThe economic collapse of the 50s made the burden of maintaining the Heer's budget a titanic struggle. Although many begged for funds to be funneled elsewhere, Hitler stood by the Wehrmacht and would not hear of it. Therefore, for the last two decades, Germany has somehow miraculously maintained its military budget, for better or worse without another major economic crisis.\n\nMilitarists in both the Wehrmacht and administration continue to lobby to maintain current spending to this day. On the other side of the aisle, a coalition of reformers, civilian interests, industrialists, and even limited numbers of conservatives from the NSDAP beg us to cut the Wehrmact's budget for much needed allocation of funds elsewhere. Being in a position of power ourselves combined with Hitler's ailing health allows us to now make a change in policy, if we so choose."

A casual observer may mistake active duty warships in dock as a mothballed fleet! It is only under Admiral Dönitz's personal care that the U-boat fleet is even somewhat combat ready.\n\nThere are no disagreements throughout the administration; the surface fleet is severely lacking. Our analysts estimate that even the Italian surface fleet is stronger than ours! Them! A disgrace! To get the navy up to a standard befitting our status as a superpower would require nothing short of a total restructuring of our navy, complete with new ships, technology, and tactics. At this time, there is no feasible way we can achieve this. However, there are some temporary remedies available to us.\n\nBy cutting some of the Admiral's salaries and reducing waste, room in the naval budget for substantial improvements is possible. Be it weapon system overhauls, repairs, new electronics, or even just a new coat of paint, we have an opportunity to finally shape up the Kriegsmarine."

Many veterans were given lands to settle, positions of power and influence, prestige and more than their share of wealth. This was easy enough to handle following the days of our great victory.\n\nThis has set a precedent of entitlement. Yet another generation of soldiers are retiring, and there isn't near the amount of wealth to go around; there simply hasn't been any new conquests. Still, they expect, and even DEMAND the same compensation the heroes of the last war were gifted, even the men who haven't seen a lick of battle! The most vocal of the new veterans are the last of our men to see real war; the veterans of the West Russian Conflict. There is no doubt that they suffered greatly to hold back the tide of red rats that threatened Moscowien, and therefore only ask for their fair share.\n\nIt is time we handled retirement benefits once and for all, so we can finally end the debate of what the veterans are due."

Day by day, our grasp on Europe grows ever more tenuous and I shudder to think of what might happen once our great Führer dies." That was at least what Otto Ernst Remer. Oh, how Göring detested the angry little man.

I mean, we were the first to get a man on the moon. I think there are still some years left yet in our Third Reich. After all, we are not yet even close to the thousandth year - am I not right Reichsmarschall Göring?" Wilhelm Stuckart was a long-time friend, supporter, and ardent National Socialist. As far as he knew, Europe was theirs and the future of the Reich was no longer about further conquest.\n\n"Well, uh..." Göring looked at Schörner's lackey before returning his gaze towards Wilhelm Stuckart.

Stuckart of course did not take it sitting down and leapt up in indignation to begin what would be a shouting match between him and the ardent Schörnerite.\n\nGöring excused himself from the meal to no one's notice. It would have been a waste to sign away his great popularity with the likes of Schörner and his band of merry mad men. No, destiny awaited. Surely, the successor would be rather eager to enlist the help of none other than Hermann Göring himself.

To celebrate this historic moment, I wish to extend a cordial invitation to a dinner at Carinhall. I have been told that you are a man of expensive taste and on that front I believe that Carinhall is second to none. I have also heard that you are a man of many ideas and reforms, one who wishes to bring the Reich to new heights. Although my past exploits were of the military kind, one thing I have learned in my time as a politician is this: one can never have too many men to keep the peace when less imaginative minds wish to keep things "the way they were". For such fiends, I can only recommend the bayonet. I understand that your Gang of Four would be your main advisors, but perhaps there is room for one more. My popular support and military prowess would no doubt shore up further support for your cause, and there is no other government that I would rather serve under than yours.\n\nSincerely,"

reich.702.d:0 "Albert Speer thought it amusing how informal and relaxed the letter was after reading and re-reading it. The letter barely seemed the type of correspondence that could have had far-reaching consequences on the Reich Speer was to inherit and manage going forwards. For a moment, it was tempting: Göring was a media darling and also someone who would no doubt move a lot of fence-sitters towards his side, but everything else about him would be more trouble than he was worth. Primarily, his very nature would create an imbalance in the already fragile Gang of Four. His old sabre-rattling reputation would put him at odds with Schmidt, and his terrible economic ideas would no doubt butt heads with Erhardt. Göring too was a man who enjoyed the spotlight and would probably try to steal it from old 'Silver Tongue' Kiesigner and, well, Tresckow...\n\n"Herr Speer, Tresckow is waiting in the lobby to see you."\n\nSpeak of the devil. "Oh, send him in, please. Thank you." Speer had made up his mind by now: Tresckow would be the one to handle this. Göring and Tresckow were never amicable in the first place. Perhaps Schörner would enjoy knowing about this also. Of course, the details could all be handled in due time. When Tresckow opened the door, he was surprised that Speer had been standing up and waiting for him - seeming more animated than his usual self. For once perhaps, they may yet agree upon something."

Bormann, with envelope in hand, slowly walked towards the burning fireplace crackling on the far side of the room.\n\nAs the shadows of his fingers flickered in front of the fireplace, it had given him an idea. Göring wanted to get away from his puppeteers. The fool that he was, Bormann was going to bet that those shadow masters would no doubt wish to see this little letter he had. He turned back towards his desk and sat down once more, letter in hand. Picking up the phone, Bormann said to his secretary: "Could you put Feldmarschall Schörner on the line?"\n\n"Of course.

By a stroke of luck, Schörner believed him - but Göring knew that Naumann wouldn't. It wasn't as if he didn't try, explaining to the Reichsminister how the militarists had done that on his behalf. After all they'd been through, Göring had thought there would have been some quotable last words on either side - but Naumann didn't even manage to finish his sentence before hanging up on Göring in exasperation and disbelief. In one phone call, his conservative support had died.\n\nAs he strolled through Carinhall's art section, one painting caught his eye. It was one of Napoleon; he was sinking into his chair, defeated. There was no commanding gaze, no passionate look, it was a blank stare towards nothingness. Initially, it was there as a matter of pride: nowadays, who, after all, was the Master of Europe? The Führer's was not French, let alone one called "Napoleon". However, now Göring looked at the painting with a new sense of empathy. If Schörner and his War Plans were successful, then he would no doubt go down in history as one greater than Napoleon ...but Göring knew deep down he was no Napoleon. Even with the greatness of the Reich, the later War Plans would be near impossible to achieve. On that day, when his armies falter and his people groan, he wondered if someone would ever make a painting of him."

Martin Bormann's forces have been driven out of the culturally rich city, but at a hefty price. Germans from both sides lay strewn throughout what remains of the city. Though damaged, many of Leipzig's culturally significant buildings still stand, although heavy artillery bombardment has devastated the industrial parks, and many civilians wander the streets, digging through the rubble for lost loved ones. In the center of the city, over three hundred men have created a formidable holdout in the Monument to the Battle of Nations, though surrounded and low on supplies, it is expected they will surrender soon.\n\nBormann has suffered a great defeat today. It remains to be seen if his loyalists will be able recapture this strategically important city, or if it will remain occupied indefinitely."

Bormann loyalists were spread throughout the city. Combined with a hostile civilian population, the aggressors had no choice but to sweep the city house by house, apartment by apartment, block by block. The city was, for all intents and purposes, a giant fortress.\n\nHeavy urban fighting has taken its toll on both sides, along with the civilian population. Thousands are dead, and the city has been gutted. The loss of this stronghold is a disaster to Bormann and his men; if the frontlines can't soon be stabilized, much of southern Germany will lay wide open to attack.

Some early reports estimate that over 60% of the city has been destroyed, and the little housing that remains have quickly become quarters for the newly arrived conquerors.\n\nAs most of the civilian population that remains scrounges for the few resources that lay unclaimed, only one question remains unanswered; will Bormann return?"

Bormann's loyalists fought in every street. Civilians were press ganged into labor brigades, homes transformed into makeshift bunkers, and streets blocked off with an assortment of ruble, ruined vehicles, and whatever else could be tossed into the streets. Massive bombardments softened the city before the main attack commenced, and combined with an equally determined infantry assault, the defenders were forced to withdraw from the city.\n\nBorman's position is precarious; with enemies deep into Southern Germany, many speculate that his faction is close to collapse.

News of what the men found at the Monument to the Battle of Nations has spread far and wide; those three-hundred who bravely died are being hailed as heroes and martyrs by their comrades; their charred remains finally being put to rest.\n\nThe fighting has exhausted both attackers and defenders. It is to be seen if Bormann will be able to keep up his momentum and push deeper into Germany proper, or if this is the extent of his resurgence. In any case, Martin Bormann is by no means out of this war just yet."

Gunshots ring out as a nearby group of men are led to a standing wall and forced to kneel, their betrayal paid back with a single bullet to the head. Rabid civilians meanwhile hunt down whatever stragglers they can. Usually, the ex-occupiers are simply beaten to death, but more than a few corpses hang from street lights and buildings, the sign Verräter usually nailed or hung to the body.\n\nRecapturing Nuremberg has given the NSDAP loyalists a much needed moral boost.

Back and forth battles raged for important buildings that still overlooked tactically vital areas of the now ruined city. Strongpoints too stubborn to fall were repeatedly hit with ballistic and ground-based missiles by the attackers. Supported by tanks and APCs, one by one the city blocks began to fall. Cars loaded with bombs and artillery shells were the response, and more than a few of the surprised attackers met a grisly fate as these makeshift bombs started to hit convoys, troops formations, armor and strong points. Refusing to surrender after the fall of the city, Speer's forces abandoned their military wear and blended into what remains of the civilian population, which is currently being brutalized as the conquerors exact revenge and try to root out the remains of the reformers.\n\nWhile this bloodbath raged on, Albert Speer and his most important advisors quietly left the city, their current location unknown.

Hundreds of innocent Germans line the streets, blood still oozing from their heads or dripping from the walls they were lined up against. Perhaps the worst sight is at the Goethe University.

Saying the fighting was underhanded would be a vast understatement; Speer's militia used the mostly intact sewers to move around while pickup trucks with heavy machine guns bolted down in the beds sped through the streets. Speer's staff claim that their enemies resorted to using poison gas underground, and resorted to mining many of the streets to attempt to halt their enemy's relentless advance. Using the night as cover, one final mass assault decided the fate of the city; the occupiers were forced to withdraw after being simply overwhelmed by the ferciosity and numbers of the reformers offensive.\n\nThe city is battered; most of its industry is in ruins, the infrastructure is barely functional, and the civilian population is in dire need of relief. Still, the capital and home of the reform movement is one again in Speer's hands. The victory has given the battered reformers some much needed hope."

Perhaps as many as three thousand civilians tried to escape the warzone by boat, but the harbor had been mined, most of the shipping was sunk as a result, along with their human cargo. Göring's men meanwhile laced most of the major parts of Kiel with explosives, and used the resulting destruction and chaos to withdraw from the city, at the expense of the civilians.\n\nGöring has been driven out of the strategically important city, and the rest of Jutland lays open, but the human cost has once again been great."

The citizens of Rostock watched with dread as the fighting crept closer and closer to the city. Hopeful citizens rejoiced when the enemy advance stopped just short of the city. The celebrations were cut short as a shocking artillery and aerial bombardment rocked the entirety of the city.\n\nIt is suspected that the would be conquerors were simply tired of the protracted resistance, and that such a brazen show of strength would break the city's spirit. The bombardment had the opposite intended effect. The civilians, who had up to this point been indifferent supporters of Göring, rose up in anger and defense of their homes.\n\nSaying the line between civilian and soldier was blurred is a vast understatement. After sustaining heavy small-arms fire from plain clothed civilians all across the ruins, many people wearing plain clothes were simply shot on sight in the streets, with few exceptions. In response, the fighting took to the underground. The city's vast drainage and sewer systems were extensively used by Göring and his newfound allies to great effect. So great, in fact, that the underground systems were "allegedly" gassed more than once, and combat engineers were deployed to collapse the tunnels, increasing the damage to the already destroyed city. Rostock University, one of the oldest centers of higher education in the world and headquarters of the defenders was hit multiple times by ballistic missiles, completely leveling it. It wasn't until after the fighting concluded that the attackers learned that it was actually being used as a hospital and refuge for suffering citizens; not a single soldier was killed in the strikes, and there are well over a thousand dead buried in the rubble.\n\nGöring's men, bloodied and battered, have retreated from the broken bones of the city, covered by his airforce.

Strong points were meticulously chosen throughout the city, and many first generation settlers volunteered to take up arms against the approaching enemy army, refusing to see their homes fall without a fight.\n\nBoth sides got their fight. The attacker's dreams of a quick victory was dashed as they ran head first into the outer fortresses. Even after sustained heavy artillery fire, missile strikes, armored assaults, and then massed infantry attacks were only some of the fortresses compromised. Trying to assault the city with nearly half of the outer fortresses still operational proved to be disastrous and a constant thorn in the side as the defenders stubbornly fought on inside the city itself. A daring assault by professional army soldiers finally split the defenders in half, ending organized resistance in Posen.\n\nAlthough the city is still a warzone, enough control has been established for the attackers to claim victory.

As they were pushed deeper into the city, the SS began to use literal human shields; hundreds of men, women, and children were forced to march towards the enemy lines as SS troops followed close behind with panzers and armored APCs.

However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

Admirals from across the Reich, from every conceivable fleet and theatre, have apparently sent communiques to Theoderichshafen commending Dönitz's actions. His denunciations have evidently hit a chord with much of the German navy, particularly those who had been feeling uneasy about publicly choosing a side in the civil war, offering an apparently 'neutral' face-saving alternative. A fanciful story has even begun to circulate about four sailors from Wilhelmshaven who jumped overboard and swam over a mile to land when the captain announced his support for Albert Speer instead of Dönitz.\n\nWith ships from across the Reich rallying to Dönitz's banner, and therefore, to Bormann's, prospects are looking increasingly dim for the other contenders. Luckily for us, a number of admirals have publicly rebuffed Dönitz's overtures, openly mocking the hypocrisy of executing a coup against the Crimean governor in order to protest a markedly similar event in Germania."

What was unexpected, however, was the discovery of the body of Reinhard Heydrich in his office.\n\nKilled from a single shot to the forehead as he sat behind the desk, the state of the office suggests that Heydrich was in the process of packing up to leave when he was killed, and reportedly other evidence further implies that he did not expect his sudden demise.

There was Heydrich, the black Knight, surrounded by fanatics. Speer, the Pawn, bowing to the whims of the so-called 'Gang of Four'. Then there was his strongest rival, Hermann Göring, the King.

Some, however, will be remembered more than others.\n\nToday, the entire Wehrmacht honors the final retirement of Erwin Rommel, the "Desert Fox" who led the Italo-German invasion of British Africa. The old general, who had been living as a civilian for almost a decade, had rejoined the army in the civil war, bringing with him his legendary ability with Panzer tactics: while no longer a tank commander due to his old age, his keen insight in armor warfare, combined with the legendary reputation that followed him ever since the days of the Afrika-Korps, inspired many to fight well beyond their own capabilities.\n\nNow, however, the tired Fox has announced his second - and final - retirement from the Wehrmacht, citing his failing health and the sadness from fighting fellow Germans as the main reasons. While some would have wanted to keep him to help rebuild the armed forces, no one dared suggest it, so respected he was. After a final parade where he saluted the crowd atop an old Panther tank, he was escorted to his home covered in even more medals than he already has, to enjoy his final years."

I know the ten of you are busy men, so thank you for dropping your prior commitments for this important meeting."\n\nIn front of you are packets of what is expected of us in the next two or so hours. Take five minutes and review it." The various junior staff officers, some of the brightest in the Heer, looked at the contents of the slim flies in front of them in surprised silence. Discipline won the day however, the only reactions being occasional looks of surprise.\n\n"It's an honor sir," one of the junior officers finally spoke out. Another chimed in. "What do you require of us?"\n\nFor five hours, the eleven men walked around a physical map of the British isles. Known radar stations, missile silos, naval ports, locations of shipyards and civilian ports, anti air weapon systems, and more. Anything that could in any way affect military preparations was mapped, tagged, logged, or noted. Potential beaches for landings were all marked, and potential areas where landing forces could get bogged down were duly mapped. The results were mixed.\n\n"There's potential." was the word of the day. "But so much could go wrong," was often the reply. "Should we rely on the Luftwaffe again?" Followed by "They'd expect that, what about the navy?" to only be countered by "We still need to invade the damn island." Finally, after hours hunched over the map, the senior officer finally straightened his back.\n\n"You are all correct." The noisy room fell silent. "Like in the Second Weltkrieg, all of our branches will need to work together to ensure success. Neither the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, or the Heer will be enough to crack the island. As we've seen," the man pointed at the map. "The island looks more like a fortress than it did two decades ago. Modern radar. Missile silos for ground, air, and sea targets. Small numbers of jet planes, portable surface to air missiles, and more. We will need to give the operation our all. Every plane, ship, and man will be needed to minimize losses. Control of BOTH air and sea is essential." "But sir. Their missile systems will cause great damage no matter how we approach the island. How do we handle that?" an officer asked.

"I don't mean to be sharp, and I shouldn't shoot the messenger, but take a look. You guys are simply asking too much!"\n\n"I know, sir. It is a lot. But apparently the order comes straight from the Fuhrer's office himself. They want every plane with a jet in the air, within reason. End quote." The older man groaned softly. "We just got done fixing the last gen interceptors and fighters on the base. We haven't even touched the Hortens, let alone the Junkers. And do you know how many parts the bombers need? Christ.

The worst damage is our oil storage tanks at the harbors were damaged. The valves were tampered with and forced open before being broke. The harbors are a goddamn mess right now.

For him to join a doomed uprising that would ensure Nazism to be lost in echoes and for his children to be disintegrated into the ashes of destiny and time.\n\nHe awakened from the call of his son, scarcely a decade old, holding his morbidly wounded arm.

He saw his comrades from the underground, all around him, their bodies grey and still. From his numbness he knew he would soon join them to the end. He extended his arm and pulled his son close, and told with his dying breath to walk towards the sunrise until they reach the mythical new homeland, a place where they would never be lost again. The child's grip did not falter, the pain of loss too providential in his hands. The boy prayed for God to deliver them from evil, for a world where they never had to suffer.\n\nAs his son begged for the Lord's mercy, he remembered the vision he saw, and he decided that nothing could have ever made him give up his only son.

Out of the ashes of Iberia, however, rises something polarizing in Europe, dreaded in America and Japan, and reluctantly accepted on the peninsula itself- the División Azul, now the Frente Azul, have won a decisive victory and now lay claim to all of the Union's former territories.\n\nThe Frente Azul, being the radical wing of the fascist Falangists, have close ties to the Reich- having fought alongside the Wehrmacht in the 40's, their loyalties to National Socialism have never truly faded away. Instead, they bode their time, waited to strike, and have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. This, too, has presented us with an unprecedented opportunity- the opportunity to accept the Frente Azul into the Einheitspakt, expanding our reach to the shores of the Medditerreanean.\n\nOn paper, this seems to be a no brainer, but reports of massive brutality, governmental instability, and a deep air of resentment among the Iberian populace seems to warn of a quagmire on the level of South Africa and Indonesia- and we know from recent experience that wars in Iberia can drag on for years. Such tremors have been enough to scare some of our high-ranking officials away from the offer, but others claim that the benefits of access to the Mediterreanean are simply too good to ignore. The decision falls to the Führer to sort out."

The miles of bunkers, pillboxes and constantine wire that crawl along the islands coast can be attributed to the military decision-making back in Washington, as can its artificial harbors that were made deep enough for the vast hulls of the United States Navy to harbor into. The Airforce, never to be outdone by the other branches, put a titanic amount of effort into clearing and building the vast concrete hangers that dot the island's many airfields which allow the fearsome B-52 to take off within a moment's notice, representing SAC's nuclear first strike capabilities.\n\nWith all decisions routed through the Pentagon, it was no wonder that the small fishing issue was ignored for so long by military analysts as it just wasn't seen as a priority. British fishing trawlers had been clawing ever closer to the coveted fisheries in Icelandic waters, butting heads with the Icelandic fishing industry and causing quite a stir in the minority civilian population on the island.\n\nThe Pentagon has finally agreed to expand the Exclusive Economic Zone of Iceland, to better enforce her waters.

We must decide- are the Americans bluffing, or do they mean business?"

GER_USA_codwars.17.b:0 "They're bluffing. We'll show them what the Reich does with these threats."

GER_USA_codwars.18.desc:0 "In a stunning reversal to weeks of steadily increasing tension, it seems that Germany has finally blinked first in the international game of Chicken. Today, it has been announced that an immediate apology will be issued, the captured American sailors will be released with the exception of the captain, who will be tried, and immediate reparations will be paid to the family of the deceased American sailor. This sudden change of heart is a massive diplomatic coup for the United States, as well as being a hammer to the heart for the Reich.\n\nIn cities across America, parades are being planned out for the brave soldiers coming home from the Reich's clutches. Similarly, in cities across Germany, protests against the government's supposed weakness are already beginning to form. This situation is already being hailed by many analysts across the globe as a microcosm of the Cold War as a whole- a Reich that still pretends to be the same juggernaut it once was, but is overpowered by the new, ascendant America in the end. Such symbolism is not lost on the people of either nation."

GER_USA_codwars.19.desc:0 "Admiral McCain Jr's binoculars were plastered firmly to his eyes. For the first time in weeks, the big ships in the Kriegsmarine were moving. He watched them closely- were they retreating? Now, after everything, were they just packing up and heading out? It was impossible.\n\n"Should I radio the other ships, Admiral?" The radioman asked. McCain said nothing. This whole motion was confusing him. Perhaps that was the point of it- to confuse and threaten the Americans into retreating? No, that would be a foolish bluff. His eyes moved across to one of the big battleships, and suddenly he froze.\n\nHe was staring down the barrel of the battleship's guns.\n\nIn an instant, a flash of white engulfed his vision, and he dropped the binoculars. A moment later, the alarm blared as shells impacted all around the fleet, crashing through superstructures and puncturing hulls. In a moment, the USN fired back, and the ship shook with the force of the roaring cannonfire. McCain turned to the radio operator. He rushed over and began to yell into his ear, struggling to be heard over the cacophony of war."

GER_USA_codwars.20.desc:0 "Diplomacy has failed. As we speak, the forces of the Reich march to war, and the two Eagles engage in their final clash. In the waves of the North Atlantic, burning hulks slowly sink below the waves, the victims of the largest naval battle since World War Two. There's no question about it now- World War Three is upon us.\n\nWhat happens from here? Nobody truly knows. The militarists, of course, predict a swift victory for the Reich- a final decimation of the American menace. The outlook, of course, is not so rosy. No matter whether we are victorious or not, it seems that nuclear war is no longer just a nightmare, but instead soon to be a reality. Plans are already being made for the government to attempt to evacuate Germania, but most know it's pointless. The end of the world is at hand. All that is left is to fight until one side pulls the trigger."

GER_USA_codwars.21.t:0 "Off To War"
GER_USA_codwars.21.desc:0 ""Members of the Congress, I must bring terrible news today. At 11:23 a.m today, forces of the United States Navy were fired on by elements of the Kriegsmarine. The ensuing battle cost hundreds of lives, but it also heralds the death of something else- the death of the tenuous peace we have attempted to maintain. Once again, the United States finds itself under attack by an enemy hell-bent upon its destruction, along with the values that we members of the free world hold so close to our hearts."\n\nNixon cleared his throat, looking up from his hastily written speech. He knew this speech would be the one his presidency would forever be remembered by- a speech to call America to action, a speech to herald the death of civilization. It was an arduous task- one he hoped he would serve justice to.\n\n"I understand the task that I am calling the American people to fulfill, and I understand its implications, as I'm sure all members of this Congress do as well. However, I know that we, as Americans, can accomplish this task. We will not lay down and let the tide of Nazism wash over all that we hold dear. We will fight back against the darkness and, God willing, end it by the sword. I call upon this Congress to sign off on a declaration of war against the German Reich and all those who stand with it!"\n\nAs the room washed with applause, Nixon looked around at the faces and cameras that surrounded him. He knew he was signing off on the world's death warrant. But what else was there to do? America would defend itself, and it would never be humiliated again."
